1:1	adjg	207176	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	I made the first account	1	Luke assumes that Theophilus will know that by **the first account** he means the book that has become known as the Gospel of Luke. Since that book was not known by that title at this time, it would not be accurate to put the title in your translation as a name that Luke would have used to describe the book to Theophilus. However, you could explain this in a footnote and use another expression here. Alternate translation: “I wrote in my first volume”
1:1	rcpb	207177		O Theophilus	1	Here Luke is identifying and addressing the man for whom he complied this account of the early church. Since this is like the salutation of a letter, in your translation you may wish to follow your culture’s way of identifying and greeting the addressee of a letter. UST models this by saying “Dear Theophilus” and putting the phrase at the beginning of the sentence.
1:1	b083	207178	How to Translate Names [26805]	Theophilus	1	**Theophilus** is the name of a man. It means “friend of God.” It may be his actual name, or it may describe what this man was like. Most translations treat it as his name.
1:1	nqfj	207179	Making Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information Explicit [26688]	about all that Jesus began both to do and to teach	1	Luke is using the word **began** to indicate that Jesus had been doing something else (working as a carpenter) but then began to do something new when he started his ministry. In your language, it might not be necessary to translate the word **began**, since it might seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express. Alternate translation: “all that Jesus both did and taught”
1:1	wwsk	207180	Hyperbole [26695]	about all that Jesus began both to do and to teach	1	This is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “about some of the most important things that Jesus did and taught”
1:2	owgz	207181	Idiom [26697]	until that day	1	While this did happen on a specific day, Luke is likely using the word **day** to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “up to the time when”
1:2	qmpa	207182	Active or Passive [26672]	he was taken up	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God took him up”
1:2	vc74	207183	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	he was taken up	1	Luke is referring to Jesus being **taken up** into heaven. See the discussion of “Ascension” in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “he was taken up into heaven” or “God took him up into heaven”
1:3	at86	207184		to whom also, after he had suffered, he presented himself living with many proofs	1	As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Jesus also presented himself alive with many proofs to his apostles after he had suffered”
1:3	n6ih	207185	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	after he had suffered	1	This refers to how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. Alternate translation: “after he had suffered and died on the cross”
1:3	bn95	207186	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	with many proofs	1	The word translated **proofs** describes items of evidence that are decisive and convincing. Alternate translation: “with many definitive proofs”
1:3	ftg1	207187	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	appearing to them for 40 days and speaking	1	While the antecedent of **whom** is “the apostles whom he had chosen” in the previous verse, Jesus actually appeared to many other disciples besides his apostles. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “For 40 days he appeared to his apostles and many of his other disciples, and he spoke”
1:3	w4sw	207188	Abstract Nouns [26671]	things concerning the kingdom of God	1	See the discussion of the concept of the **kingdom of God** in Part 2 of the General Introduction to Acts. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **kingdom**, you could express this with a verb such as “rule,” as UST does.
1:4	x24k	207189	Double Negatives [26679]	not to depart from Jerusalem, but	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **depart**. Alternate translation: “to remain in Jerusalem and”
1:4	sowk	207190	Quote Markings [26720]	not to depart from Jerusalem	1	The content of Jesus’ instructions to the apostles on this occasion begins here. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate and punctuate the material from here to the end of the verse as a direct quotation, as UST does.
1:4	dwle	207191	Metonymy [26707]	the promise of the Father	1	Jesus is referring to the Holy Spirit by association with the way God made a **promise** to send the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit, whom the Father promised”
1:4	abej	207192	Translating Son and Father [26763]	of the Father	1	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “of God the Father”
1:4	ulaa	207193	Direct and Indirect Quotations [26719]	which you heard from me	1	In keeping with his engaging storytelling style, Luke begins a quotation from Jesus here without introducing it with a formula such as “he said.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include an introductory formula in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He said, ‘You heard about this from me’” or “He said, ‘I told you about this’”
1:4	up82	207194	Forms of You [26731]	you heard	1	Here, **you** is plural because Jesus is speaking to the apostles, so use the plural form of “you” in your translation if your language marks that distinction. In 1:6, “you” is singular because Jesus alone is being addressed, so the singular form would be accurate there. In general these notes will not discuss whether **you** is singular or plural when this should be clear from the context, but they will address ambiguous cases where this may not be clear.
1:5	oeev	207195	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	John	1	Jesus is referring to the man who was known as John the Baptist because he baptized people. It may help to identify him if you use that title after his name in your translation. However, because the word “Baptist” is associated with a group of churches in many parts of the world, it may be helpful to your readers to use a different form of the word as a title, as UST does by saying “Baptizer.” Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” or “John the Baptizer”
1:5	u6wh	207196	Metaphor [26706]	you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit	1	After describing earlier in the verse how John baptized people literally, Jesus is using baptism in this second instance as a metaphor. See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit will come and empower you”
1:5	m4pd	207197	Active or Passive [26672]	you will be baptized	1	You may wish to retain the metaphor of baptism in your translation. If you do, and If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you can say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will baptize”
1:5	ez85	207198	Litotes [26704]	after these not many days	1	Jesus is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “just a few days from now”
1:6	jp23	207199	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	They therefore having assembled, they were asking him	1	In the first instance, **they** describes Jesus and the apostles, while in the second instance, **they** refers to the apostles. (Other disciples could have been present on this occasion, but the instructions that Jesus gives about being “witnesses” in 1:8 apply specifically to the apostles, so it would be good to name them directly.) Alternate translation: “When the apostles were together with Jesus, the apostles were asking him”
1:6	vahh	207200	Idiom [26697]	if you are restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time	1	This is an idiomatic way of asking a question. Alternate translation: “are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time” or “will you now restore the kingdom to Israel”
1:6	jcbq	207201	Abstract Nouns [26671]	if you are restoring the kingdom to Israel	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **kingdom**, you could express the same idea with a noun such as “king.” Alternate translation: “are you going to give Israel its own king again” or “are you going to become the restored king of Israel”
1:7	fbed	207202	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	It is not for you to know	1	Jesus is saying implicitly by this response that he is not going to tell the apostles when the thing they are asking about will happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “I am not going to tell you when that will happen, because it is not for you to know”
1:7	kw91	207203	Doublet [26680]	the times or the seasons	1	The words **times** and **seasons** could: (1) refer to different kinds of time. Alternate translation: “the general period of time or the specific date” (2) have similar meanings, being used together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the exact time”
1:7	lfcu	207204	Translating Son and Father [26763]	the Father	1	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God the Father”
1:7	qyxf	207205	Abstract Nouns [26671]	by his own authority	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **authority**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “control.” Alternate translation: “as the one who controls all things”
1:8	h3af	207206	Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship [26745]	you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses	1	Jesus is using the word translated **and** to describe a result. Alternate translation: “when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, then you will receive power to be my witnesses”
1:8	a69l	207207	Abstract Nouns [26671]	power	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **power**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “powerful.” Alternate translation: “powerful ability”
1:8	espt	207208	Idiom [26697]	to the end of the earth	1	This is a reference to place, not to time. Jesus does not mean “until the world ends.” Alternate translation: “all over the world” or “to the places on the earth that are farthest away from here”
1:9	uyoz	207209	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	as they were looking	1	Your language may require you to specify the object of **looking**. Alternate translation: “as they were looking at him”
1:9	p390	207210	Active or Passive [26672]	he was raised up	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. (See the discussion of “Ascension” in the General Notes to this chapter.) Alternate translation: “he rose up” or “God raised him up”
1:9	u7sx	207211	Metonymy [26707]	from their eyes	1	Luke is using the **eyes** of the apostles to mean their capacity to see. Alternate translation: “from their sight”
1:10	k6l5	207212	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	they were looking intently into heaven	1	Since a cloud was able to block the apostles’ view, it is clear that Luke is using the word translated **heaven** here in one of its specific senses to mean “sky.” It would be good to make clear that the apostles were not seeing into heaven itself. Alternate translation: “gazing at the sky”
1:10	creh	207213	Metaphor [26706]	and behold, two men	1	Luke is using the term **behold** to focus readers’ attention on how suddenly these **two men** appeared. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “just then two men”
1:10	kwgo	207214	Connect — Sequential Time Relationship [26747]	And	1	Luke uses the word translated **And** to indicate that the event of the men appearing happened after the event of Jesus going up. Alternate translation: “Then”
1:10	sp3n	207215	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	two men	1	These were actually angels. Luke calls them **men** because they appeared in human form. Alternate translation: “two angels”
1:10	tfdj	207216		white clothes	1	In this context, the word **white** likely has the specific sense of “bright” or “shining.” Alternate translation: “bright clothes” or “shining clothes”
1:11	exo9	207217	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	they said	1	This could mean: (1) one of the angels had spoken on behalf of both of them. Alternate translation: “one of them said” (2) the two angels had each said different parts of the quotation.
1:11	kbxx	207218	Verbs [26730]	they said	1	If you retain the word **they** in your translation and if your language uses dual forms for verbs, it would be accurate to use the dual form here, since two men are speaking.
1:11	g9rs	207219	Idiom [26697]	Men, Galileans	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “You Galileans”
1:11	ptdj	207220	Rhetorical Question [26724]	why do you stand looking into heaven	1	The angels are not looking for information. They are using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “there is no reason for you to stand looking into heaven!”
1:11	nsbn	207221	Idiom [26697]	why do you stand looking	1	The expression **stand** means to continue doing something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “why do you keep looking” or “there is no reason for you to keep looking”
1:11	wv5l	207222	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the one having been taken up from you into heaven,  &  you saw him going into heaven	1	In its second occurrence in this sentence, the term translated **heaven** likely means “the sky,” as in the previous sentence and in the previous verse. However, in its first occurrence in this sentence, the term likely means “heaven” itself. It would not be accurate to say that Jesus was just “taken up from you into the sky.” Alternate translation: “who has been taken up from you into heaven … you saw him going into the sky”
1:11	ms3p	207223	Active or Passive [26672]	the one having been taken up	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “whom God has taken up”
1:11	nzut	207224		the way	1	Alternate translation: “in the same way in which”
1:12	fnkg	207225	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	they returned	1	The word **they** refers to the apostles. Alternate translation: “the apostles returned”
1:12	e84c	207226	Active or Passive [26672]	the hill that is called Olivet	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the hill that people call Olivet” or “the hill whose name is Olivet”
1:12	idgh	207227	How to Translate Names [26805]	the hill that is called Olivet	1	**Olivet** is the name of a hill. If your readers might recognize it better if you called it the Mount of Olives, you could use that name in your translation, as UST does.
1:12	aixb	207228	Idiom [26697]	having a journey of a Sabbath	1	The expression **having a journey** refers to a distance. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a Sabbath-day’s journey away”
1:12	i6cm	207229	Translate Unknowns [26822]	having a journey of a Sabbath	1	The **journey of a Sabbath** was the distance that interpreters of the law of Moses had determined people could walk on the Sabbath without that being “work.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the distance in the measurement that your culture uses. Alternate translation: “about a kilometer away” or “about half a mile away”
1:13	q9x7	207230	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	when they arrived	1	The previous verse explains that the apostles returned to Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that again explicitly here. Alternate translation: “when they arrived back in Jerusalem”
1:13	wlez	207231	Translate Unknowns [26822]	they went up into the upper chamber where they were staying	1	In this culture, in some houses, rooms were built on top of other rooms. The expression **upper chamber** describes such a room, which was reached by stairs. If your culture does not have houses like that, it may be helpful to explain the meaning of the expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “they climbed the stairs to the room where they were staying, which had been built on top of other rooms in the house”
1:13	emfr	207232	Idiom [26697]	James of Alphaeus  &  Judas of James	1	These are two occurrences of an idiom. Alternate translation: “James the son of Alphaeus … Judas the son of James”
1:13	jfhd	207233	How to Translate Names [26805]	James of Alphaeus  &  Judas of James	1	These are the names of four men. As the UST indicates, the man named **James** who was the father of **Judas** is not the same man as the James who is mentioned first in this verse, and he is also not the same man as James the son of Alphaeus.
1:13	q5yq	207234	How to Translate Names [26805]	Simon the Zealot	1	**Simon** is the name of a man, and **Zealot** is another name by which he was known. (1) **Zealot** could be a title that indicates that this man was part of the group of people who wanted to free the Jewish people from Roman rule. Alternate translation: “Simon the Patriot” (2) **Zealot** could also be a description that indicates that this man was zealous for God to be honored. Alternate translation: “Simon the Passionate One”
1:14	u330	207235		unanimously	1	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. Alternate translation: “with one accord” or “harmoniously”
1:14	lstu	207236	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the women	1	Luke assumes that his readers will know he is referring to the women who accompanied Jesus and his disciples during his ministry. These women provided for them out of their own means, and they had traveled with them to Jerusalem. These women are described in Luke 8:2–3 and 23:49. Alternate translation: “the women who had helped Jesus and his disciples during his ministry”
1:14	ubzq	207237	Kinship [26799]	his brothers	1	These were Jesus’ younger brothers. They were the sons of Mary and Joseph. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half-brothers. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “younger brother,” you may wish to use it here.
1:15	luuo	207238	Introduction of a New Event [26833]	And in those days	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. The phrase refers to the period of time after Jesus ascended, when the disciples were meeting in the upper chamber. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
1:15	iu0i	207239	Idiom [26697]	in those days	1	Luke is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “during that time”
1:15	p1lv	207240	Symbolic Action [26816]	having stood up	1	Peter **stood up** to indicate that he had something important to say. Alternate translation: “having stood up to show that he had something important to say”
1:15	se1x	207241	Metaphor [26706]	of the brothers	1	Luke is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. Alternate translation: “his fellow believers”
1:15	yll3	207242	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	of the brothers	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Luke is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. As the General Introduction to Acts suggests, here and throughout the book, if you retain this figurative usage in your translation, you could state “brothers and sisters” to indicate that it has this generic sense.
1:15	kk95	207243	Background Information [26829]	and the multitude of names to the same was about 120	1	Luke provides this background information to help readers appreciate what happens shortly afterwards in the story, when the church grows in one day to many times this size. It may be helpful to put this background information first in the verse as a separate sentence, in which case it would not have to be in parentheses. Alternate translation: “Now the number of people in that one place was about 120.”
1:15	hc1n	207244	Metonymy [26707]	the multitude of names	1	Luke is using the term **names** to mean “people,” by association with the way that people have names. Alternate translation: “the number of people”
1:15	w6ea	207245		to the same	1	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “in that one place” or “in their Christian fellowship”
1:16	d8od	207246	Idiom [26697]	Men, brothers	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My brothers”
1:16	vjno	207247	Metaphor [26706]	Men, brothers	1	See how you translated the term **brothers** in 1:15. Alternate translation: “My fellow believers”
1:16	va8v	207248	Information Structure [26700]	it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled that the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, the one having become a guide to the ones arresting Jesus	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could put the information that Peter provides to identify this **scripture** before his statement that it had to be **fulfilled**. It may be helpful to make that statement a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to the ones who arrested Jesus. It was necessary for that scripture to be fulfilled”
1:16	g1bs	207249	Active or Passive [26672]	it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the things needed to take place that the scripture described” or, if you put the background information first as a separate sentence, “What that scripture described needed to take place”
1:16	scqv	207250		spoke before	1	Alternate translation: “spoke beforehand” or “spoke in advance”
1:16	v24e	207251	Metonymy [26707]	by the mouth of David	1	Peter is using the word **mouth** to refer to words that David spoke or sang using his mouth and that he recorded in the book of Psalms, as Peter indicates in 1:20. Alternate translation: “through the words of David”
1:16	f3zl	207252	Synecdoche [26729]	the one having become a guide to the ones arresting Jesus	1	Peter is using the act of guiding **the ones arresting Jesus** to represent all of the things that Judas did to betray Jesus. This also included meeting beforehand with his enemies, receiving payment for the betrayal, and looking for the best opportunity to catch Jesus away from the crowds. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in more general terms. Alternate translation: “who betrayed Jesus to his enemies”
1:17	s90y	207253	Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship [26745]	For	1	Peter uses the word **For** to introduce the reason for a result that is described in 1:21–22, after Luke provides further background information and Peter quotes the scripture he referred to in 1:16. The overall meaning is, “Since Judas was one of us apostles, we need to replace him with another witness of the ministry of Jesus.” But since so much material comes between the reason and the result, it may be helpful to give an indication here that Peter has a response in mind. Alternate translation: “There is something important we need to do in response to this scripture being fulfilled, since”
1:17	ksn2	207254	Parallelism [26713]	he was numbered with us and received a share of this ministry	1	These two phrases mean similar things. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “Jesus chose him to be an apostle along with us”
1:17	dvtm	207255		he was numbered with us	1	Peter is using the term **numbered** in one of its specific senses. Alternate translation: “he was considered to be one of us apostles”
1:17	mjzt	207256	Active or Passive [26672]	he was numbered with us	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “he belonged to our group of apostles”
1:17	vu1y	207257	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	with us	1	Although Peter is addressing a larger group of people, he is using the word **us** to refer only to himself and the other apostles. So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “us,” it would be accurate to use the exclusive form here. Other languages may have other ways of indicating that **us** is exclusive here. Alternate translation: “with us apostles”
1:17	yk8e	207258	Quote Markings [26720]	a share of this ministry	1	Luke temporarily ends his quotation from Peter after this phrase so that he can provide further background information about Judas in 1:18–19. The quotation resumes in 1:20. If you are identifying quotations in your translation by putting them within quotation marks or by using some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, there should be an ending quotation mark or the equivalent after this phrase.
1:18	zc94	207259	Background Information [26829]	Now indeed	1	Luke is using this expression to introduce further background information that he provides in this verse and the next one about how Judas died and about what people called the field where he died. This is not part of Peter’s speech. You may want to indicate that by putting these verses in parentheses or by using the equivalent convention in your language.
1:18	byl4	207260	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	this one	1	Luke is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Judas. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could state “he” or use the name “Judas.”
1:18	q2zy	207261	Abstract Nouns [26671]	from the wage of unrighteousness	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **unrighteousness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “unrighteous.” Alternate translation: “with the money that he received for doing an unrighteous deed”
1:18	uvfm	207262	Metonymy [26707]	from the wage of unrighteousness	1	Luke is using the term **unrighteousness** to describe Judas betraying Jesus, by association with the way that was an unrighteous thing to do. Alternate translation: “with the money that he received for betraying Jesus”
1:18	moyh	207263	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	having become prostrate	1	Luke does not say how Judas became prostrate, that is, how his body landed face-down on the field. It is clear, however, that Judas did not just trip and fall accidentally. Rather, it seems that his body forcefully hit the field as he was killing himself. Alternate translation: “in his attempt to kill himself his body struck that field”
1:18	i9vq	207265	Active or Passive [26672]	all his entrails were poured out	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “all his inward parts poured out”
1:19	xegf	207266		it became known to all those living in Jerusalem	1	The verb form is not passive here, since **known** is an adjective rather than a participle. Even so, it may be helpful to your readers to make **it** the object rather than the subject. Alternate translation: “all those living in Jerusalem heard about it”
1:19	wa7u	207267	Hyperbole [26695]	it became known to all those living in Jerusalem	1	Luke says **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “it became well known to those living in Jerusalem”
1:19	b12s	207268	Active or Passive [26672]	Therefore that field was called	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “So they called that field”
1:19	lofk	207269	Copy or Borrow Words [26821]	Akeldama	1	**Akeldama** is an Aramaic word. Luke spells it out using Greek letters so his readers will know how it sounds, and then he says what it means, **Field of Blood**. In your translation you can spell it the way it sounds in your language and then explain its meaning.
1:20	oy93	207270	Quote Markings [26720]	For it is written	1	Luke now resumes his quotation of what Peter said on this occasion. If you are identifying quotations in your translation by putting them within quotation marks or by using some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, there should be an opening quotation mark or the equivalent before this phrase. It may also be helpful to indicate explicitly that the quotation resumes here. Alternate translation: “Peter went on to say, ‘For it is written’”
1:20	m393	207271	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	it is written in the book of Psalms,	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “it is written in the book of Psalms that his habitation should be made desolate, with no one dwelling in it, and that another should take his overseership”
1:20	i6f9	207272	Active or Passive [26672]	it is written in the book of Psalms	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “David wrote in the book of Psalms”
1:20	em26	207273	Third-Person Imperatives [26699]	Let his habitation become desolate,	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “May his habitation become desolate, and may no one be dwelling in it” or “His habitation should become desolate, and no one should be dwelling be in it”
1:20	d2a5	207274	Imperatives — Other Uses [26698]	Let his habitation become desolate,	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a request rather than a command. The psalmist is asking God to judge and punish the wicked. Use a form in your language that communicates a request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please let his habitation become desolate, and please let no one be dwelling in it” or “Please may his habitation become desolate, and please may no one be dwelling in it”
1:20	y8r8	207275	First, Second or Third Person [26670]	Let his habitation become desolate,	1	It may be more natural in your language to use the second person for this imperative. Alternate translation: “God, please make his habitation desolate, and please make no one dwell in it”
1:20	q27x	207276	Parallelism [26713]	Let his habitation become desolate,	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Or you could combine the phrases if you think that would be the clearest thing to do. Alternate translation: “Let his habitation be made desolate, yes, let no one dwell in it” or “Let his habitation be made completely desolate”
1:20	gjg3	207277	Metaphor [26706]	Let his habitation become desolate,	1	The word **habitation** likely refers to Judas’ home and is a metaphor for his family line. Alternate translation: “May he leave no descendants, none to continue his family line”
1:20	v7as	207278		Let another take his overseership	1	The word **overseership** refers to a position of leadership and supervision. It is the same term that Paul uses for a spiritual leader in 1 Timothy 3:1. Alternate translation: “Let someone else take his leadership position”
1:20	n6in	207279	Third-Person Imperatives [26699]	Let another take his overseership	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “May another take his overseership” or “Another should take his overseership”
1:20	sd0l	207280	Imperatives — Other Uses [26698]	Let another take his overseership	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a request rather than a command. The psalmist is continuing God to judge and punish the wicked. Use a form in your language that communicates a request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please let another take his overseership” or “Please may another take his overseership”
1:20	gtht	207281	First, Second or Third Person [26670]	Let another take his overseership	1	It may be more natural in your language to use the second person for this imperative. Alternate translation: “God, make another take his overseership” or “God, please give his overseership to another”
1:21	yli2	207282	Verse Bridges [26824]		1	To help your readers understand Peter’s main point in this verse and the next one, you could combine both verses into a verse bridge. You could put his main point in a first sentence and his further explanation in a second sentence. Alternate translation: “Therefore it is necessary for someone else to become a witness with us of Jesus’ resurrection. It should be one of the men who accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day that he was taken up from us.”
1:21	ee8c	207283	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	us  &  us	1	In the first instance of **us**, Peter means himself and his fellow apostles, not everyone to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of the word if your language marks that distinction. However, in the second instance of **us**, Peter could well mean himself and his entire audience, so use the inclusive form in that instance.
1:21	relt	207284	Idiom [26697]	the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us	1	Peter is speaking in an idiomatic way. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus lived among us”
1:22	amz6	207285	Abstract Nouns [26671]	beginning from the baptism of John	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **baptism**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “baptize.” Alternate translation: “beginning from when John started baptizing people”
1:22	cn7x	207286	Idiom [26697]	the day on which	1	While Jesus was taken up to heaven on a specific **day**, Peter may be using the word **day** to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “the time when”
1:22	xq6y	207287	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	he was taken up  &  of his resurrection	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus, not to John the Baptist. The pronoun **his** also refers to Jesus. For clarity, you may want to use the name Jesus instead of one or both of these pronouns. Alternate translation: “Jesus was taken up … the resurrection of Jesus”
1:22	amgf	207288	Active or Passive [26672]	he was taken up from us	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God took him up from us”
1:22	q7wq	207289	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	from us—  &  with us	1	When Peter says **from us**, he is referring to God taking Jesus from everyone to whom he is speaking. But when Peter says **with us**, he means only himself and the other apostles. So the word “us” would be inclusive in the first instance and exclusive in the second instance, if your language marks that distinction.
1:22	td41	207290	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	one of these	1	Peter is using the demonstrative adjective **these** as a noun to refer to specific people, the men whose qualifications he has just described. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “one of these men is”
1:22	xqbx	207291	Abstract Nouns [26671]	of his resurrection	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **resurrection**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “alive.” Alternate translation: “that God made him alive again after he died”
1:23	v0fa	207292	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	they stood up two	1	The pronoun **they** refers to all of the believers who were present on this occasion. This is the group that Luke describes as “the brothers” in 1:15. Alternate translation: “the believers stood up two”
1:23	p5gy	207293	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	they stood up two	1	Luke is using the adjective **two** as a noun to refer to specific people, two men who met the qualifications Peter described. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning, and you could also describe these men more specifically. Alternate translation: “the believers stood up two men” or “the believers stood up two men who met the qualifications that Peter described”
1:23	bx4u	207294	Symbolic Action [26816]	they stood up two	1	When the believers **stood up** these two men, that is, when they had them stand up within the group, this was a symbolic way of proposing them as candidates to replace Judas. Alternate translation: “the believers proposed two men who met the qualifications that Peter described”
1:23	dt6s	207295	How to Translate Names [26805]	Joseph,  &  Barsabbas,  &  Justus	1	**Joseph** is the name of a man, and **Barsabbas** and **Justus** are two other names by which he was known. **Barsabbas** is probably a patronymic, that is, an indication of who his father was. If your language and culture identify people by patronymics, it may be helpful to translate this name as “the son of Sabbas,” as UST does. **Justus** is a Roman name, and it may be a name that this man used for official purposes and in interactions with people who spoke Latin. (It would be like the name Paul, by which Saul of Tarsus was also known in the Roman Empire.)
1:23	fao1	207296	Active or Passive [26672]	called Barsabbas, who was named Justus	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state both of these things with active forms. Alternate translation: “whom people called Barsabbas and whose other name was Justus”
1:23	xsel	207297	How to Translate Names [26805]	Matthias	1	**Matthias** is the name of a man.
1:24	bs5a	207298	Verse Bridges [26824]		1	Judas betrayed Jesus and abandoned his position as an apostle. The person who is praying says that in the next verse. As a result, the believers are asking God to show them whom he has chosen to replace Judas, as the person praying says in this verse. You could put the reason before the result by creating a verse bridge. UST provides a model for doing that.
1:24	nqt3	207299	Hendiadys [26694]	praying, they said	1	Together the words **praying** and **said** indicate that the believers said what they did while praying. Alternate translation: “they said in prayer” or “they prayed”
1:24	udxw	207300	Synecdoche [26729]	praying, they said	1	The pronoun **they** refers to all of the believers, but one of the apostles alone probably spoke these words on behalf of everyone. Alternate translation: “as the believers were all praying together, one of the apostles said”
1:24	y5c0	207301		You, Lord, heart-knower of all	1	Alternate translation: “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all people”
1:24	plm5	207302	Metaphor [26706]	You, Lord, heart-knower of all	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Alternate translation: “You, Lord, who know the thoughts and motives of all people”
1:24	l1mz	207303	Forms of ‘You’ — Formal or Informal [26734]	You, Lord	1	The word **you** is singular because the person who is praying is addressing God. If your language has a formal form of “you” that it uses to address a superior respectfully, you may wish to use that form in your translation. However, it might be more natural in your language for someone who has a good, close relationship with God to address God using the informal form of “you.” Use your best judgment about what form to use here.
1:24	k2uv	207304	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	which one from these two you have chosen	1	The person who is praying is using the adjective **two** as a noun to refer to specific people, the two men whom the believers have proposed. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “which one of these two men”
1:25	aqrs	207305	Hendiadys [26694]	to take this place of ministry and apostleship	1	The person who is praying is expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **apostleship** identifies what kind of **ministry** this is. Alternate translation: “to take this place of apostolic ministry”
1:25	yi96	207306	Metaphor [26706]	from which Judas turned aside	1	The expression **turned aside** means that Judas stopped performing this ministry. Alternate translation: “which Judas stopped fulfilling”
1:25	k2dz	207307	Euphemism [26682]	to go to his own place	1	This phrase uses a mild expression to describe Judas’ death and likely also his judgment after death. Alternate translation: “and died under God’s judgment as a result”
1:26	xo24	207308	Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship [26745]	And	1	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce what the believers did as a result of Peter’s speech. Alternate translation: “So”
1:26	t7jj	207309	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	they cast lots for them	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the believers and the pronoun **them** refers to Joseph and Matthias. You may want to specify that for clarity. (But if you decide to retain the pronoun **them** and if your language marks the dual form, **them** would be dual because it refers to those two men.) Alternate translation: “the believers cast lots to decide between Joseph and Matthias”
1:26	n3mu	207310	Translate Unknowns [26822]	they cast lots for them	1	The term **lots** describes objects with various markings on different sides that were used, most likely by dropping them on the ground, to select between possibilities. The belief was that God would control which way these objects fell and so guide the selection process. Alternate translation: “they threw marked objects on the ground, trusting that God would use these to guide them whether to choose Joseph or Matthias”
1:26	wdhb	207311	Idiom [26697]	the lot fell to Matthias	1	The word **fell** means “selected.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the lot selected Matthias”
1:26	sxhw	207312	Active or Passive [26672]	he was chosen together	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could state this in active form. Alternate translation: “the believers chose him”
2:1	jg6t	207313	Introduction of a New Event [26833]	And when the day of Pentecost was completely filled	1	Luke uses this time reference to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
2:1	texo	207314	Idiom [26697]	when the day of Pentecost was completely filled	1	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “when the day of Pentecost had come” or, if your language does not speak of days “coming,” “on the day of Pentecost”
2:1	ydto	207315	Active or Passive [26672]	when the day of Pentecost was completely filled	1	Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to use an active form of the verb “fill” in place of the passive form of that verb here. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, but your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here.
2:1	v07f	207316	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	they were all together	1	Here the word **they** refers to the apostles and the other 120 believers whom Luke mentions in 1:15. Alternate translation: “the apostles and all the other believers were together”
2:1	tl2e	207317		to the same	1	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “in the same place” or “in united Christian fellowship”
2:2	rqjy	207318		from heaven	1	The word translated **heaven** could mean: (1) “the sky.” Alternate translation: “from the sky” (2) the sound came from **heaven** itself.
2:2	gchf	207319	Simile [26728]	as of a strong wind being borne along	1	Luke is using a simile to describe what this wind was like. You could use the same simile in your translation, or you could use a different comparison, to a similar loud sound that your readers would recognize. It may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “It sounded like a strong wind being borne along”
2:2	tf01	207320	Metaphor [26706]	a strong wind being borne along	1	Luke speaks of the wind as if it were being carried through the air. Alternate translation: “a mighty, rushing wind”
2:2	ni3m	207321	Metaphor [26706]	it filled the whole house	1	Luke speaks of this sound as if it **filled** the **house**. Alternate translation: “it could be heard throughout the house”
2:2	yafq	207322		the whole house	1	Luke may be using the word translated **house** in one of its specific senses to mean a building. So this could have been either a private home or a larger building. Alternate translation: “the entire building”
2:2	lzcr	207323	Idiom [26697]	where they were sitting	1	Luke may be using the term **sitting** to mean “meeting.” Alternate translation: “in which they were meeting”
2:3	yktg	207324		tongues as if of fire	1	This phrase means “something like tongues of fire,” and a “tongue of fire” means a “flame of fire.” (The expression is used with that meaning in Isaiah 5:24, for example.) This is not a simile. Luke is describing what these objects looked like. Alternate translation: “objects that looked like flames of fire”
2:3	gtui	207325		distributing themselves	1	This means that the objects that looked like flames of fire spread out so that there was one on each person. Alternate translation: “spreading around”
2:3	sb9a	207326	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	they sat upon each one of them	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the objects, and the pronoun **them** refers to the disciples. Alternate translation: “one of the objects sat upon each one of the disciples”
2:3	t9vi	207327	Metaphor [26706]	they sat upon each one of them	1	Luke is using the word **sat** to indicate that the objects remained in one place once they had spread around. Alternate translation: “one of the objects remained on each one of the disciples”
2:4	wqm5	207328	Active or Passive [26672]	they were all filled with the Holy Spirit	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit filled them all”
2:4	o9ir	207329	Metaphor [26706]	they were all filled with the Holy Spirit	1	Luke is speaking as if the believers were containers that the Holy Spirit **filled**. Alternate translation: “they were all inspired by the Holy Spirit” or “the Holy Spirit inspired them all”
2:4	lq06	207330	Making Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information Explicit [26688]	they began to speak in other languages	1	Luke is using the word **began** to indicate that the disciples had been doing something else (speaking in their own languages) but then began to do something new when the Holy Spirit filled them. It might not be necessary to translate the word **began**, since it may seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express in your language. Alternate translation: “they spoke in other languages”
2:4	qrjr	207331	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	they began to speak in other languages	1	The implication, as 2:6–11 makes clear, is that the disciples were speaking languages that they did not know. Alternate translation: “they began to speak in languages that they did not know”
2:4	db14	207332		as the Spirit was giving them to speak out	1	Here, **giving** has the sense of enabling. Alternate translation: “as the Spirit was enabling them to speak out”
2:4	jrkq	207333		as the Spirit was giving them to speak out	1	The word translated **to speak out** means to speak clearly and articulately. To express this meaning, it may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The Spirit was enabling them to speak these languages clearly and articulately”
2:5	a3ux	207334	Connect — Background Information [26746]	Now	1	Luke uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. You can translate it with a word or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language.
2:5	a25d	207335	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	godly men	1	Luke is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “godly people”
2:5	fgvl	207336	Hyperbole [26695]	every nation	1	The word **every** is a generalization that emphasizes that the people came from many different nations. Alternate translation: “many different nations”
2:5	cmbu	207337	Idiom [26697]	under heaven	1	The expression **under heaven** is a way of referring to being on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “on earth”
2:6	nm6y	207338	Active or Passive [26672]	was confused	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state what did the action. Alternate translation: “what they heard confused them”
2:6	ib6s	207339	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	each one was hearing them speaking in his own language	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the believers and the pronoun **his** refers to each person in the multitude. Alternate translation: “each person in the multitude could hear one of the disciples speaking in that person’s own language”
2:7	h5z4	207340	Doublet [26680]	they were  &  amazed and were marveling	1	The terms **amazed** and **marveling** mean similar things. Luke may be using the two terms together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “they were … greatly amazed”
2:7	qiyu	207341	Active or Passive [26672]	they were all amazed and were marveling	1	The expression **were … amazed** is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be helpful to your readers to use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. Alternate translation: “this amazed all of them and they were marveling”
2:7	g6qb	207342	Metaphor [26706]	Behold	1	**Behold** is an expression that speakers use to focus the attention of their listeners on what they are about to say. Though it literally means “look” or “see,” the term can be used to get people to pay attention. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “In fact”
2:7	frrx	207343	Rhetorical Question [26724]	are not all these who are speaking Galileans	1	The speakers are not looking for information. They are using the question form to express their amazement. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate their words as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “all of these people who are speaking are Galileans!”
2:8	abzc	207344	Rhetorical Question [26724]	And how are we hearing, each in our own language in which we were born	1	The speakers do not expect someone to be able to answer this question for them. Rather, they are using the question form to express their amazement. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate their words as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “So we should not each be hearing them speak in our own languages in which we were born!”
2:8	tugp	207345	Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship [26745]	And	1	The speakers are using the word translated **And** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “So”
2:8	ttsd	207346	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	how are we hearing, each	1	Your language may require you to specify the object of **hearing**. Alternate translation: “how are we each hearing them speak”
2:8	zxf8	207347	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	we  &  our	1	The speakers are using the words **we** and **our** to refer to themselves and to their listeners, so use the inclusive forms of those words if your language marks that distinction.
2:8	zgbr	207348	Metaphor [26706]	in which we were born	1	The speakers say that they **were born** in these languages to mean that they learned them from birth. Alternate translation: “that we learned from birth”
2:8	lwlp	207349	Active or Passive [26672]	in which we were born	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. However, since this is a metaphor, it would be preferable to use another expression to explain its meaning, rather than to say something like “in which our mothers gave birth to us.” Alternate translation: “that we learned from birth”
2:9	i4r1	207350	How to Translate Names [26805]	Parthians  &  Medes  &  Elamites	1	These are names of three people groups.
2:9	kejk	207351	How to Translate Names [26805]	Mesopotamia, Judea  &  Cappadocia, Pontus  &  Asia	1	These are names of five areas.
2:10	yakj	207352	How to Translate Names [26805]	Phrygia  &  Pamphylia, Egypt  &  of Libya	1	These are names of four areas.
2:11	n2za	207353		both Jews and proselytes	1	The term **proselytes** describes converts to the Jewish religion. The phrase **both Jews and proselytes** could apply specifically to the visitors from Rome mentioned at the end of the previous verse, or it could apply to the whole list of people in 2:9–11. Alternate translation: “both Jews and converts to the Jewish religion”
2:11	epwq	207354	How to Translate Names [26805]	Cretans  &  Arabians	1	These are names of two people groups.
2:11	zyzb	207355	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	the great things of God	1	The speakers are using the adjective **great** as a noun. (The term is plural; ULT adds **things** to show this.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the great things that God has done”
2:12	g14j	207356	Doublet [26680]	they were all amazed and were perplexed	1	The words **amazed** and **perplexed** mean similar things. Luke is using them together to emphasize that the people could not understand what was happening. Alternate translation: “they were very perplexed”
2:12	y0ys	207357	Active or Passive [26672]	they were all amazed and were perplexed, saying	1	These are not passive verbal forms. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be helpful to your readers to use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. Alternate translation: “this amazed and perplexed all of them, and they said”
2:12	smaf	207358	Idiom [26697]	What does this want to be	1	The expression **want to be** is a way of referring to what something means. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Or, if it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “What does this mean?” or “What is the explanation for this”
2:13	bctk	207359	Active or Passive [26672]	They are filled with sweet wine	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. However, it would be preferable to use an equivalent expression that conveys the meaning rather than to say something like “sweet wine has filled them.” Alternate translation: “They have drunk their fill of sweet wine”
2:13	m3sq	207360	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	They are filled with sweet wine	1	The implications of this statement are that the disciples have gotten drunk and are babbling and that this is the explanation for the languages the people think they are hearing. Alternate translation: “They have gotten drunk on sweet wine, and so what we are hearing is just drunken babbling”
2:13	tu2k	207361	Translate Unknowns [26822]	with sweet wine	1	This refers to wine that is thicker and more intoxicating than ordinary wine. If your readers would not be familiar with this drink, you could use the name of another strong drink that they would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “with strong liquor”
2:14	odi9	207362	Symbolic Action [26816]	But Peter, having stood with the eleven, raised up his voice	1	Peter **stood** to show that he had something important to say, and the other apostles **stood** with him to show their support for him as he spoke. You could indicate that in your translation, perhaps as a separate sentence, if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “But Peter stood up to show that he had something important to say, and the other apostles stood with him to show their support for him as he spoke. Peter raised up his voice”
2:14	kp57	207363	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	the eleven	1	Luke is using the adjective **eleven** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the other 11 apostles”
2:14	fsr6	207364	Idiom [26697]	raised up his voice and spoke out to them	1	The idiom **raised up his voice** means that Peter spoke loudly. Alternate translation: “spoke out to them in a loud voice”
2:14	zw6a	207365	Idiom [26697]	Men, Jews	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My fellow Jews”
2:14	d4wl	207366	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	Men, Jews	1	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the idiomatic form of address in your translation, follow the convention in your language that indicates a mixed group of people.
2:14	va37	207367	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	all the ones inhabiting Jerusalem	1	This seems to mean implicitly people who are not Jews but who live in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “all of you non-Jews who are residents of Jerusalem”
2:14	cjnw	207368		let this be known to you	1	This expression means that Peter wants to explain the meaning of what the people are seeing and hearing. Alternate translation: “let me explain this to you” or “I am going to explain this to you”
2:14	rq65	207369	Third-Person Imperatives [26699]	let this be known to you	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “may this be known to you” or “this should be known to you”
2:14	glhb	207370	Active or Passive [26672]	let this be known to you	1	The word translated **known** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be clearer for your readers if you use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. The adjective **known** expresses the result of action by a different agent (**you**), so you can use an active form with that agent as the implied subject. Alternate translation: “know this”
2:14	akaa	207371	Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship [26745]	and	1	Peter uses the word translated **and** to indicate what his listeners should do as a result of what he has just told them. Alternate translation: “so”
2:14	cxbk	207372	Metonymy [26707]	take my words into your ears	1	Peter is using the term **words** to mean what he is about to say by using words, and he is using the term **ears** to mean the capacity for listening. Alternate translation: “listen carefully to what I am about to say”
2:15	xq36	207373	Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship [26745]	For	1	Peter says **for** in this first instance to introduce the reason why the crowd should listen to him. Alternate translation: “You should listen to me because”
2:15	aopl	207374	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	these	1	The demonstrative pronoun **these** refers to the disciples who are speaking different languages. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could add more information to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “these people who are speaking different languages”
2:15	fs1j	207375	Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship [26745]	for	1	Peter says **for** in this second instance to introduce the reason why the people speaking different languages are not drunk. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They are not drunk, because”
2:15	qll6	207376		it is the third hour of the day	1	In this culture, people began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this in the way the people of your culture reckon time. Alternate translation: “it is nine o’clock in the morning”
2:15	nicm	207377	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	it is the third hour of the day	1	Peter assumes that his listeners will know that people do not get drunk that early in the day. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “it is only nine o’clock in the morning, and people do not get drunk that early”
2:15	a0bp	207378	Ordinal Numbers [26807]	the third hour of the day	1	If you decide to translate this in the way that the biblical culture reckoned time, but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “hour three of the day”
2:16	vz6a	207379	Active or Passive [26672]	this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “this is what God said through the prophet Joel”
2:16	shrs	207380	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel	1	The implication is that God is now making happen what he said through Joel. Alternate translation: “you are seeing God make happen what he announced earlier through the prophet Joel”
2:17	oyyq	207381	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	And it will be in the last days,” God says,	1	The material in 2:17–21 contains a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting Peter, Peter is quoting Joel, and Joel is quoting God. You could avoid having a third-level quotation by moving the phrase **God says** to before the quotation from Joel. (The phrase itself does not occur in the passage from Joel that Peter quotes. It appears to be something that Peter supplies within the quotation to show that God is the speaker. Since that is the case, putting it before the quotation would not change the actual biblical text.) Alternate translation: “God said, ‘And it will be in the last days, I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh’”
2:17	fek2	207382	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	And it will be in the last days,” God says,	1	You could also avoid having a second-level quotation by turning the direct quotation into an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “God said that in the last days he would pour out his Spirit on all flesh”
2:17	uc38	207383		And it will be	1	Alternate translation: “This is what will happen” or “This is what I will do”
2:17	ndb4	207384		the last days	1	See the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes to this chapter, which recommend not interpreting or explaining it, but representing it simply as ULT does.
2:17	iugp	207385	Metaphor [26706]	I will pour out from my Spirit	1	God says that he will **pour out** his Spirit, as if the Spirit were a liquid, to mean that he will give the Spirit generously and abundantly. Alternate translation: “I will lavish my Spirit”
2:17	h1bb	207386	Metonymy [26707]	on all flesh	1	God refers to **flesh** to mean people by association with the way that people are made of flesh. Alternate translation: “to all people”
2:17	z29a	207387	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	and your sons and your daughters will prophesy	1	If you have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation, also do that here in the rest of the verse. It may be helpful to make this a new sentence. Alternate translation: “God said that our sons and our daughters would prophesy and our young men would see visions and our old men would dream dreams”
2:17	o7kv	207388	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	your  &  your  &  your  &  your	1	If you turn the direct quotation into an indirect quotation and translate these instances of **your** as “our,” use the inclusive form of the word “our” in each instance if your language marks that distinction, since Joel would be referring to himself and his listeners.
2:17	gahy	207389	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	young men  &  old men	1	God speaks separately of **sons** and **daughters** in this verse and of “male servants” and “female servants” in the next verse. But here the contrast is between **young** and **old**. So the word **men** could have a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “young people … old people”
2:18	woy6	207390	Direct and Indirect Quotations [26719]	And even on my male servants and on my female servants in those days	1	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. Alternate translation: “God said that even on his male servants and on his female servants in those days he would pour out from his Spirit, and they would prophesy”
2:18	lhk3	207391		on my male servants and on my female servants	1	If your language has masculine and feminine forms of the word “servant,” it would be accurate to use those forms here. Other languages can indicate this distinction in other ways, as ULT does with the adjectives “male” and “female.”
2:18	sizi	207392	Idiom [26697]	in those days	1	Here, **days** means a specific time. Alternate translation: “at that time”
2:18	rkbt	207393	Metaphor [26706]	on  &  on  &  I will pour out from my Spirit	1	See how you translated this in 2:17. Alternate translation: “to … to … I will give my Spirit abundantly”

2:19	rzzh	207396		in the heaven above	1	Since God specifies in the next verse that these **wonders** will affect the sun and the moon, the word translated **heaven** likely has the specific sense of “sky.” Alternate translation: “in the sky above”

Alternate translation: “God said that sun would be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood before the great and remarkable day of the Lord came”
2:20	rv4n	207399	Active or Passive [26672]	The sun will be turned to darkness	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form.

2:20	wf1k	207400	Metaphor [26706]	The sun will be turned to darkness	1	God is speaking as if he would change the **sun** into something else. Alternate translation: “The sun will become dark” or “The sun will no longer shine brightly”
2:20	f2o0	207401	Abstract Nouns [26671]	The sun will be turned to darkness	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **darkness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “dark.” Alternate translation: “The sun will become dark”
2:20	rud5	207402	Ellipsis [26681]	and the moon to blood	1	Here some words have been left out that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “and the moon will be turned to blood”
2:20	ahh9	207403	Active or Passive [26672]	and the moon to blood	1	If you decide to supply words as the previous note suggests, but your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form. Alternate translation: “and I will turn the moon to blood” or, if you are making this an indirect quotation, “and that he would turn the moon to blood”
2:20	fw32	207404	Metaphor [26706]	and the moon to blood	1	God is speaking as if he would change the **moon** into something else. Alternate translation: “and the moon will look like blood” or “and the moon will appear to be red”
2:20	rkjv	207405	Doublet [26680]	great and remarkable day	1	The words **great** and **remarkable** mean similar things. They are being used together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the very great day” or “the truly remarkable day”
2:20	korj	207406	Idiom [26697]	day of the Lord comes	1	This is an expression that many of the prophets use. It refers to the time when God will judge and punish people for their sins. Alternate translation: “the time when the Lord judges and punishes people for their sins”
2:20	jszi	207407	First, Second or Third Person [26670]	day of the Lord comes	1	In this expression, God is speaking of himself in the third person.

2:21	z5jt	207415	Quote Markings [26720]	will be saved	1	This is the end of Joel’s quotation of the Lord. If you chose to mark the Lord’s words as a third-level quotation, indicate that ending here with a closing third-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. It is also the end of Peter’s quotation of Joel. If you chose to mark Joel’s words as a second-level quotation, similarly indicate the ending of that quotation within a quotation.
2:22	d83e	207416	Idiom [26697]	Men, Israelites	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My fellow Israelites”

2:27	il9t	207454	Parallelism [26713]	you will not abandon my soul to Hades,	1	These two statements mean similar things. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it may be helpful to show that to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **nor** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “you will not abandon my soul to Hades, no, you will not allow your Holy One to see decay”
2:27	igzu	207455	Forms of ‘You’ — Formal or Informal [26734]	you will not abandon  &  nor will you allow your	1	The words **you** and **your** are singular, and they refer to God. See what you decided to do in your translation in 1:24 in a similar case where God is addressed as “you.” You may have decided in such cases to use a formal form of “you” that your language may have, or you may have decided to use an informal form of “you.”
2:27	r6ha	207456	Synecdoche [26729]	you will not abandon my soul to Hades	1	The Messiah says **my soul** to mean himself, using one part of his being to represent his whole being. Alternate translation: “you will not abandon me to Hades”
2:27	bhux	207457	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	your Holy One	1	The expression **Holy One** is a title for the Messiah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your Messiah” or “your holy Messiah”
2:27	gctz	207458	First, Second or Third Person [26670]	your Holy One	1	The Messiah is referring to himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person in your translation. Alternate translation: “me, your Holy One” or “me, the Messiah”
2:27	cwqn	207459	Idiom [26697]	to see decay	1	Here the word **see** is being used to mean “experience.” Alternate translation: “to experience decay”
2:27	j79h	207460	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	to see decay	1	The term **decay** refers in this context to the decomposition of the body after death. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to experience the decomposition of his body”
2:28	e24a	207461	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	You made known to me the paths of life;	1	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation of David into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. If so, it may be helpful to add some introductory material here. Alternate translation: “The Messiah said that God had made known to him the paths of life and that God would fill him with gladness with his face”
2:28	ss3b	207462	Forms of ‘You’ — Formal or Informal [26734]	You made known  &  you will fill  &  your	1	The words **you** and **your** are singular and they refer to God. See what you decided to do in the similar case in 1:24.
2:28	ypjc	207463	Metaphor [26706]	You made known to me the paths of life	1	The Messiah speaks of **life** as if it consisted of **paths** that a person walked along. Those represent the various pursuits and adventures that people have in life. The word **known** refers to experiential knowledge. Alternate translation: “You enabled me to experience the adventures of life once again”
2:28	i1k8	207464	Metaphor [26706]	you will fill me with gladness	1	The Messiah speaks as if he were a container that God could **fill** with **gladness**. Alternate translation: “you will give me great gladness”

2:28	jom6	207466	Quote Markings [26720]	with your face	1	This is the end of Peter’s quotation of David. If you chose to mark David’s words as a second-level quotation, in your translation you can indicate this ending with a closing second-level quotation mark or whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses.
2:29	nopq	207467	Idiom [26697]	Men, brothers	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My brothers”
2:29	rgs0	207468	Metaphor [26706]	Men, brothers	1	Often in the New Testament, the term **brothers** refers to fellow believers in Jesus, as it does in 1:15. But here, Peter is addressing fellow Jews who are not yet believers in Jesus, but they do believe in the God of Israel. \n\nAlternate translation: "My fellow believers in God" or "My brothers and sisters"
2:29	hyp9	207469	Metaphor [26706]	the patriarch David	1	A **patriarch** is literally the ancestor of a group of people. David was not the ancestor of all the Jews to whom Peter is speaking. So he is likely using the term to identify David as the king who established the Israelite kingdom as a lasting dynasty. Alternate translation: “David, the founder of our kingdom”
2:29	wmch	207470	Active or Passive [26672]	was buried	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “people buried him”

2:30	yez4	207473	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	being a prophet and having known	1	Peter is still speaking about David. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “because David was a prophet and he knew”
2:30	pvy7	207474	Metonymy [26707]	to set from the fruit of his loins upon his throne	1	Peter is using the word **loins** to represent David himself by association with the way the reproductive organs are in the loins. He is using the word **fruit** in a broad sense to mean what someone or something produces, in this case a descendant. Alternate translation: “to set one of his descendants upon his throne”
2:30	mbjm	207475	Synecdoche [26729]	to set from the fruit of his loins upon his throne	1	When Peter says that God promised to **set** one of David’s descendants **upon his throne**, he is using that one action to represent God’s promise to David that this descendant would succeed him as king. Alternate translation: “to make one of his descendants succeed him as king”
2:31	e6b6	207476	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	he spoke  &  was he abandoned  &  his	1	The first instance of **he** refers to David, and the second instance of **he** and the pronoun **his** refer to Christ. Alternate translation: “David spoke … was Christ abandoned … Christ’s”
2:31	lc2v	207477	Abstract Nouns [26671]	he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **resurrection**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “alive.” Alternate translation: “he described how God would make Christ alive again after he died”
2:31	r6ja	207478	Active or Passive [26672]	neither was he abandoned to Hades	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “neither did God abandon him to Hades”
2:31	mfel	207479	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	of the Christ	1	**Christ** is the Greek word for “Messiah.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use the term “Messiah” in your translation, as UST does.
2:31	mpkv	207480	Idiom [26697]	nor did his flesh see decay	1	Here the word **see** is being used to mean “experience.” Alternate translation: “nor did his flesh experience decay”
2:31	rw14	207481	Metonymy [26707]	nor did his flesh see decay	1	Peter is using the word **flesh** to mean the body of Jesus by association with the way the body is made of flesh. Alternate translation: “nor did his body experience decay”
2:31	oamn	207482	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	nor did his flesh see decay	1	The term **decay** refers in this context to the decomposition of the body after death. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “nor did his body experience decomposition”
2:32	g0y9	207483	Idiom [26697]	God has raised up	1	As in 2:24, the idiom **raised up** means that God made Jesus alive again after he died. Alternate translation: “God has brought back to life”
2:32	m5rg	207484	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	we	1	By **we**, Peter means himself and the other apostles, so use the exclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction.
2:33	lyek	207485	Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship [26745]	Therefore	1	Peter is using the word **Therefore** to introduce a result. But it is not the immediate result of what he has just said. He is not saying that Jesus has done what the people see and hear because God raised him from the dead. Instead, this is an overall conclusion. Peter is saying that Jesus sending the Holy Spirit is the reason why the disciples are able to speak in other languages. The crowd should not conclude that they are babbling drunkenly, as some of them have suggested. UST models a way of expressing this sense of the word **Therefore**.
2:33	y27f	207486	Active or Passive [26672]	Therefore, having been exalted to the right of God	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “now that God has exalted Jesus to his right”
2:33	ronj	207487	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	to the right of God	1	Peter is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate the right side. See how you translated the similar expression in 2:25. Alternate translation: “to the right side of God”
2:33	l844	207488	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	to the right of God	1	In this culture, the place at the right side of a ruler was a position of honor. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to a place of honor next to God”
2:33	mnqo	207489	Possession [26717]	and  &  the promise of the Holy Spirit	1	Peter is using the possessive form to describe the Holy Spirit as someone whom God the Father promised to send. Alternate translation: “the promised Holy Spirit from the Father” or “the Holy Spirit whom the Father promised to send”
2:33	d3ib	207490	Translating Son and Father [26763]	the Father	1	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God the Father”
2:33	npyl	207491	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	he has poured out	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus has poured out”
2:33	ymfr	207492	Metaphor [26706]	he has poured out	1	Peter says that Jesus has **poured out** the things that the people are seeing and hearing as if those things were a liquid. Peter means that Jesus has given these things generously and abundantly. See how you translated the similar statement in 2:17, to which Peter is likely alluding here. Alternate translation: “he has generously given” or “he has abundantly given”
2:34	wriz	207493	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	he himself says,	1	The material in 2:34–35 contains a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting Peter, Peter is quoting another psalm by David (110:1), and David is quoting God. You could avoid having second-level and third-level quotations by translating this as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “he himself says that the Lord told his Lord to sit at his right”
2:34	jmia	207494	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	The Lord said to my Lord	1	**The Lord** means God here, and **my Lord** means the Messiah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God said to the Messiah”
2:34	mpab	207495	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	at my right	1	Here the adjective **right** is used as a noun in order to indicate the right side. See how you translated the similar expression in 2:25. Alternate translation: “at my right side”
2:34	xwzt	207496	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	at my right	1	In this culture, the place at the right side of a ruler was a position of honor. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “in a place of honor next to me”
2:35	vztq	207497	Metaphor [26706]	until I make your enemies a stool for your feet	1	The psalm says that God would make the Messiah’s **enemies** a **stool** for his **feet** to mean that God would conquer those enemies and make them submit to the Messiah. Alternate translation: “until I conquer your enemies for you”
2:35	znqq	207498	Quote Markings [26720]	for your feet	1	This is the end of David’s quotation of the Lord and of Peter’s quotation of David. If you chose to mark these in your translation as a third-level and a second-level quotation, indicate that ending here with the appropriate closing quotation marks or the comparable punctuation or convention in your language.
2:36	qgav	207499	Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship [26745]	Therefore	1	Peter is using the word **Therefore** to introduce the result of what he has just said. Alternate translation: “Since David was not talking about himself, but about the Messiah”
2:36	lsf5	207500	Third-Person Imperatives [26699]	let all the house of Israel know	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “may all the house of Israel know” or “all the house of Israel should know”
2:36	dwrx	207501	First, Second or Third Person [26670]	let all the house of Israel know	1	It may be more natural in your language to use the second person for this imperative, since to this point in his speech Peter has been addressing his audience in the second person. Alternate translation: “all you in the house of Israel, know”
2:36	crxt	207502	Metaphor [26706]	all the house of Israel	1	Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So **the house of Israel** means all the people descended from the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the entire nation of Israel”
2:37	ofnu	207503	Active or Passive [26672]	hearing this they were pierced in the heart	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “what they heard Peter say pierced their heart”
2:37	luu8	207504	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	they were pierced in the heart	1	Here the word **they** refers to the people in the crowd to whom Peter spoke. Alternate translation: “the people in the crowd were pierced in the heart”
2:37	fpzc	207505	Collective Nouns [26738]	they were pierced in the heart	1	Since Luke is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **heart**. Alternate translation: “the people in the crowd were pierced in their hearts”
2:37	jhy1	207506	Metaphor [26706]	they were pierced in the heart	1	Luke is speaking. The people were not literally **pierced in the heart** by anything. He means that the people felt guilty and became very sad. Alternate translation: “they felt guilty and became very sad”
2:37	d8kd	207507	Idiom [26697]	Men, brothers	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “Our brothers”
2:37	u64t	207508	Metaphor [26706]	Men, brothers	1	Often in the New Testament, the term **brothers** refers to fellow believers in Jesus, as it does in 1:15. But here, the crowd who does not yet believe in Jesus is addressing Peter and the other apostles with the same affectionate term that Peter used to address them in 2:29. So it seems that what they mean by it is, “fellow believers in the God of Israel.”\n\nAlternate translation: “fellow believers in our God”
2:37	k9nm	207509	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	what should we do	1	The people in the crowd are asking about themselves but not the apostles, so use the exclusive form of **we** in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
2:38	wz2p	207510	Forms of You [26731]	Repent  &  each of you be baptized  &  of your sins,  &  you will receive	1	The words **you** and **your** are plural, **you will receive** is a plural verb form, and the implied “you” in the imperative **Repent** is also plural. But the implied “you” in the imperative **be baptized** is singular, since the subject is **each**.
2:38	uz1b	207511	Active or Passive [26672]	be baptized	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “allow us to baptize you”
2:38	qzty	207512	Metonymy [26707]	in the name of Jesus Christ	1	Here the **name** of Jesus represents his authority. By being baptized, these believers were acknowledging Jesus’ authority over their lives as their Lord and Savior. Alternate translation: “to express your allegiance to Jesus Christ as your Lord”
2:38	nmv3	207513	Abstract Nouns [26671]	for the forgiveness of your sins	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **forgiveness**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “forgive.” Alternate translation: “to show that you want God to forgive your sins”
2:39	uqsv	207514	Metonymy [26707]	the promise is	1	Peter is speaking of the Holy Spirit by association with the way God promised to send the Holy Spirit, as Peter says specifically in 2:33. Alternate translation: “God has promised the Holy Spirit”
2:39	k8ay	207515	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	to you and to your children	1	Peter showed the people in 2:17 that God’s promise through Joel to pour out his Spirit included their “sons” and “daughters.” So the implication could be that the people in the crowd should not think that any of them have to reach a certain age before professing faith in Jesus and being baptized. Alternate translation: “to all of you, no matter what your age,” or see the next note for a further possibility.
2:39	sjfc	207516	Metaphor [26706]	to you and to your children	1	Peter could also be using the word **children** in a figurative sense to mean “descendants.” In that case, he would be saying that faith in Jesus as the Messiah was not something just for the people living at this time, but also for people living at all times in the future. That would parallel what he says next about faith in Jesus not being just for those who are present in this place, but for people living in all places. Alternate translation: “to you and your descendants” or “to you and everyone who will live after you”
2:39	gxwf	207517	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	to all those {being} at a distance	1	Since Peter is speaking to Jews as a fellow Jew, this is likely an implicit reference to the Jews who were living in other parts of the Roman Empire. However, this statement took on greater meaning when the church realized that “God has also given repentance unto life to the Gentiles,” as its leaders say in 11:18. So you could either express the likely initial meaning here in your translation, or you could leave the statement more general. Alternate translation: “to the Jews living in faraway parts of the empire”
2:39	e6yv	207518	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	the Lord our God	1	By **the Lord our God**, Peter means the God of the Jews. He is speaking of himself and his fellow apostles and of the people in the crowd, so use the inclusive form of the word **our** in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
2:39	pvf5	207519	Idiom [26697]	may call	1	Peter is using the word **call** in an idiomatic sense here. Alternate translation: “may bring to salvation”
2:40	zktm	207520	Metonymy [26707]	with many other words	1	Luke is using the term **words** to mean things that Peter said by using words. Alternate translation: “by saying many other things”
2:40	l3qx	207521	Hendiadys [26694]	he testified and urged them	1	Here Luke is expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The word **urged** tells in what way Peter **testified** further about faith in Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this same idea with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “he testified urgently to them”
2:40	z7zq	207522	Active or Passive [26672]	Be saved	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “Let God save you”
2:40	emat	207523	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	from this perverse generation	1	The implication is that God is going to punish **this perverse generation**. Alternate translation: “from the punishment that this perverse generation will suffer if it does not repent”
2:40	gzsv	207524	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	this perverse generation	1	The word **perverse** describes things or actions that do not conform to what is right and expected. Peter may be referring implicitly to how the people of this **generation** rejected and killed Jesus. Alternate translation: “this wicked generation that rejected and killed Jesus” or “the wicked people of this time who rejected and killed Jesus”
2:41	xhuc	207525	End of Story [26831]	Therefore	1	Luke uses the word **Therefore** to introduce information about what happened after the story of Pentecost as a result of the events within the story itself. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a story.
2:41	mmsu	207526	Idiom [26697]	having received his word	1	Here, **received** means that the people in the crowd accepted that what Peter said was true. Alternate translation: “because they believed his word”
2:41	ojes	207527	Metonymy [26707]	his word	1	Luke is using the term **word** to mean what Peter said by using words. Alternate translation: “what Peter said”
2:41	t8v7	207528	Active or Passive [26672]	they were baptized	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. The apostles themselves may have baptized all these people, but because so many people repented and wanted to be baptized, it is possible that some of the other believers may have baptized some of them. Alternate translation: “the apostles baptized them” or “the believers baptized them”
2:41	yvsw	207529	Synecdoche [26729]	souls	1	Luke is using one part of these people, their **souls**, to mean the people themselves. Alternate translation: “people”
2:41	ol07	207530	Active or Passive [26672]	were added	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “became part of the church”
2:42	d1or	207531	Abstract Nouns [26671]	they were continuing in the teaching of the apostles and in fellowship, in the breaking of bread and in prayers	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **teaching** and **fellowship**, you could express the same ideas with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “they continued to learn from what the apostles taught and to share life with one another, and to break bread together and to pray together”
2:42	ndwu	207532	Synecdoche [26729]	in the breaking of bread	1	Luke could be using the word **breaking** to mean “eating,” and he could be using the word **bread** to mean “food.” In each case he would be using one part of something to mean the whole thing. Breaking bread is one thing people do when they eat it, and bread is one kind of food. So this could be a reference to the believers sharing meals together. Alternate translation: “in sharing meals” or see the next note for a further possibility.
2:42	f4n1	207533	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	in the breaking of bread	1	By **the breaking of bread**, Luke could also mean remembering the death of Jesus in the way that Jesus commanded, by literally breaking a loaf of bread and sharing it and also sharing a cup of wine. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “in observing the Lord’s Supper”
2:43	o1e6	207534	Personification [26716]	fear was coming on every soul	1	Here the word **fear** describes a deep respect for God. Luke describes this **fear** as if it were a living thing that could come onto people. Alternate translation: “every soul began to feel a deep respect for God”
2:43	rabp	207535	Synecdoche [26729]	fear was coming on every soul	1	Luke is using one part of a person, the **soul**, to mean the entire person. Alternate translation: “every person began to feel a deep respect for God”
2:43	nmsp	207536	Hyperbole [26695]	fear was coming on every soul	1	Luke says **every** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “very many people began to feel a deep respect for God”
2:43	f625	207537	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	many wonders and signs were happening through the apostles	1	Since Luke says that these things happened **through the apostles**, the implication is that God was doing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make God the subject of this sentence and **wonders and signs** the object. Alternate translation: “God performed many wonders and signs through the apostles”
2:43	kibo	207538	Doublet [26680]	many wonders and signs	1	The terms **wonders** and **signs** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. See how you translated the similar expression in 2:22. Alternate translation: “many great miracles”
2:44	wwwm	207539		to the same	1	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “in the same place” or “united in Christian fellowship”
2:44	hqb2	207540	Hyperbole [26695]	had all things in common	1	Luke may be saying **all** as a generalization to emphasize the powerful spirit of generosity among the believers. The next verse explains more specifically how the believers showed this generosity, and you could give some indication of that here. Alternate translation: “shared their belongings with one another”
2:45	sc36	207541	Doublet [26680]	they were selling properties and possessions	1	The words **properties** and **possessions** mean similar things. Luke may be using these words together for emphasis. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They were selling many valuable things that they owned”
2:45	mztc	207542	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	and they were distributing them	1	Here the pronoun **they** refers to believers who sold things they owned, and the pronoun **them** refers to the money they received from these sales. Alternate translation: “the believers who sold these things were distributing the money that they received”
2:45	weu4	207543		to all, as anyone might have need	1	Alternate translation: “to everyone who needed help”
2:46	ok3o	207544		and, continuing unanimously every day	1	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. See how you translated the same expression in 1:14. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to start a new sentence here.

3:13	bzs1	207596	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	when that one had decided to release him	1	Peter is using the demonstrative adjective **that** as a noun to refer to a certain person, Pilate.

3:15	ol6h	207603	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the Originator of Life	1	Peter is using the expression **the Originator of Life** as another title for Jesus. This expression could be a reference to the way Jesus, as the Son of God, took part in the original creation of all life. It could also be a reference to the way Jesus gives spiritual life to all who believe in him. Or it could mean both things. In any event, Peter is drawing a contrast between the life-giving Jesus whom the people rejected and the life-taking murderer whom they asked Pilate to release. It may be best in your translation to bring out this contrast while leaving the specific meaning open. Alternate translation: “Jesus, who gives life rather than taking it”
3:15	silu	207604	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	from the dead	1	Peter is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

3:17	o0s5	207613	Metaphor [26706]	brothers	1	Peter addresses the people as his **brothers** because they are related to him as fellow descendants of the founders of the Jewish nation. Alternate translation: “my kinsmen”

3:17	q9xp	207615	Ellipsis [26681]	as also your rulers	1	Peter is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “and that your rulers also acted in ignorance”
3:18	vufn	207616	Information Structure [26700]	But what God foretold through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he has fulfilled thus	1	Your language might naturally put first in this sentence the information that God **fulfilled** prophecies when Christ suffered. Alternate translation: “But in this way God has fulfilled what he foretold through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer”
3:18	dswq	207617	Collective Nouns [26738]	through the mouth of all the prophets	1	Since Peter is speaking of a group of people, **the prophets**, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **mouth**. Alternate translation: “through the mouths of all the prophets”

3:18	b6rs	207619	Hyperbole [26695]	of all the prophets	1	Peter is using the word **all** as a generalization.

3:20	tk52	207624	Abstract Nouns [26671]	times of refreshment	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **refreshment**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “refreshing” or “restful.” Alternate translation: “refreshing times” or “restful times”

3:22	d2hr	207633	Textual Variants [26819]	The Lord our God	1	Some ancient manuscripts read “the Lord our God.” Peter would be quoting Deuteronomy 18:15 somewhat loosely but with the same basic meaning. ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “the Lord your God.” Peter would be quoting Deuteronomy 18:15 exactly. Still other ancient manuscripts read simply “the Lord God.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT.
3:22	rmml	207634	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	The Lord our God	1	Moses is speaking of himself and his fellow Israelites, whom he is addressing, so use the inclusive form of the word **our** in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
3:22	woam	207635	Idiom [26697]	will raise up for you	1	Here the expression **raise up** does not mean “bring back to life,” as it did in 2:24 and 2:32. In this context, it refers instead to God giving someone the mission to go as a prophet to certain people with a message for them. Alternate translation: “will send to you”
3:22	jyol	207636	Metaphor [26706]	your brothers	1	Moses is using the term **brothers** to mean people who are fellow descendants with his listeners of the founders of the Jewish nation. Alternate translation: “your kinsmen”

3:24	ek92	207644	Hyperbole [26695]	all the prophets	1	Here the phrase **all the prophets** is probably not the same kind of generalization that it seems to be in 3:18. It is true in a more literal sense that all the prophets **announced these days**. There was something in the messages of each one of them that pointed to the culmination of God’s work in the coming of Jesus. So even if your language does not use generalizations for emphasis, you could translate these words just as Peter says them.
3:24	ewkj	207645		from Samuel and those after him	1	Alternate translation: “beginning with Samuel and continuing with those who lived after he did”
3:24	d5fn	207646	Idiom [26697]	these days	1	Peter is using the word **days** to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “this time” or “these times”
3:24	djz3	207647	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	these days	1	Peter is referring to a specific time to mean implicitly what is happening at that time. Alternate translation: “the things that are happening now”
3:25	ejzi	207648	Metonymy [26707]	You are the sons of the prophets	1	Peter is using the word **sons** in the sense of “heirs,” by association with the way that children inherit from their parents. He means that the Israelites living at this time are going to receive something as a legacy from those who lived before them. Alternate translation: “You are the ones who are going to receive what the prophets promised” or “You are the ones who are going to experience what the prophets foretold”
3:25	jxw1	207649	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	the sons	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could state “the sons and daughters” to indicate this.
3:25	y7zw	207650	Metonymy [26707]	and of the covenant that God made with your fathers	1	The figurative sense of **sons** as “heirs” continues in this phrase. Alternate translation: “and who are going to receive what God promised to your fathers when he made a covenant with them”
3:25	q9fg	207651	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “with your fathers when he said to Abraham that in his seed all the families of the earth would be blessed”
3:25	rom4	207652	Metaphor [26706]	your fathers	1	Here, **fathers** means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “your ancestors”
3:25	so77	207653	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	your fathers	1	Although the term **fathers** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could state “your fathers and mothers” to indicate this.
3:25	f9fl	207654	Metaphor [26706]	in your seed	1	The term **seed** means “offspring.” It is a word picture. Just as plants produce seeds that grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring. Alternate translation: “through your descendants” or see the next note for a further possibility.
3:25	rpus	207655	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	in your seed	1	As the apostle Paul notes in Galatians 3:16, God used the singular form of the word **seed** when he said this to Abraham, and so the ultimate fulfillment of this promise came when God sent Jesus as the Savior for everyone in the world who would believe in him. That may also be what Peter has in view here, since he refers in the next verse to God’s “Servant,” meaning the Messiah. Alternate translation: “through the Messiah, who will be your descendant”
3:25	r1rv	207656	Active or Passive [26672]	will all the families of the earth be blessed	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “I will bless all the families of the earth”
3:25	szxs	207657	Metonymy [26707]	all the families of the earth	1	Here, **families** refers to people groups or nations by association with the way that many of them consist of people who have a common ancestry. Alternate translation: “all the nations of the world”
3:26	qtnd	207658	Idiom [26697]	God, having raised up his Servant, sent him	1	The expression **raised up** has the same meaning here as in 3:22. See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “When God appointed Jesus as the Messiah, he sent him”
3:26	n74h	207659		his Servant	1	See the discussion of the term **Servant** in the General Notes to this chapter, and see how you translated that term in 3:13. Alternate translation: “his Messiah”
3:26	bwds	207660	Metaphor [26706]	turning each of you from your wickedness	1	Here, **turning** someone **from** something means leading that person to stop doing that thing. See how you translated the similar expression in 3:19. Alternate translation: “by leading every one of you to repent of your wickedness”
3:26	huyo	207661	Abstract Nouns [26671]	turning each of you from your wickedness	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **wickedness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “wicked.” Alternate translation: “by leading every one of you to stop doing wicked things”
4:1	gbx1	207662	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	as they were speaking	1	The pronoun **they** refers to Peter and John. Alternate translation: “as Peter and John were speaking”
4:1	lfua	207663	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the captain of the temple	1	The temple had its own guards, and this man was their commanding officer. Alternate translation: “the commander of the temple guard”
4:1	s1ao	207664	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the Sadducees	1	The Sadducees would have been particularly upset that Peter and John were saying that God raised Jesus from the dead, because they did not believe in the resurrection. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain that explicitly here. Alternate translation: “the Sadducees, who do not believe in the resurrection,”
4:1	hp2s	207665	Synecdoche [26729]	the Sadducees	1	Luke is using the name of the whole group to mean some of its members. Alternate translation: “some of the Sadducees”
4:2	elmg	207666	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	greatly troubled because they were teaching	1	The pronoun **they** refers to Peter and John. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “These men were greatly troubled because Peter and John were teaching”
4:2	j3x0	207667	Abstract Nouns [26671]	proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection that {is} from the dead	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **resurrection**, you could express the same idea with an equivalent phrase. Peter and John were saying that God would raise people from the dead in the same way that he had raised Jesus. Translate this in a way that allows **the resurrection** to refer to both Jesus’ resurrection and the general resurrection of other people. Alternate translation: “proclaiming that God makes people alive again who have died, just as God had done for Jesus”
4:2	dj51	207668	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	that {is} from the dead	1	Peter is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “from among those who have died”
4:3	fdna	207669	Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship [26745]	And	1	Luke is using the word translated **And** to introduce what the men who came up to Peter and John did because they were so troubled by their teaching. Alternate translation: “So”
4:3	suia	207670	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	they laid hands on them	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees. The pronoun **them** refers to Peter and John. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees laid hands on Peter and John” or “the men who had come up to Peter and John laid hands on them”
4:3	dcre	207671	Metonymy [26707]	they laid hands on them	1	The expression **laid hands on** means to arrest someone by association with the way that arresting officers might physically take hold of a person with their **hands**. Alternate translation: “they arrested them”
4:3	fad8	207672	Abstract Nouns [26671]	put them in custody	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **custody**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “imprison.” Alternate translation: “they imprisoned them”
4:3	zmqd	207673	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	since it was already evening	1	The implication is that the ruling council, which Luke describes in 4:5–6, would not meet to question anyone at night. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “since it was already evening and the council would not meet to question them at night”
4:4	wiqu	207674	End of Story [26831]	But	1	Luke uses the word **But** to introduce information about what happened after this much of the story as a result of the events within the story itself. This is not the end of the whole story, but it is the end of a significant part of it. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a significant part of a story.
4:4	ucs5	207675	Metonymy [26707]	the word	1	Luke is using the term **word** to mean the message about Jesus that Peter and John shared by using words. Alternate translation: “the message about Jesus”
4:4	kuyz	207676	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	the number of the men	1	Luke is not using the word **men** in a generic sense here. The figure of 5,000 is the number of the men alone. It does not include women and children. So it would not be accurate to translate **men** as “people.” Instead, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this distinction explicitly. Alternate translation: “the number of the men alone, not counting the women and children,”
4:4	l6re	207677	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	became about 5,000	1	The word translated **became** could mean: (1) the community of believers in Jesus grew to a total of 5,000 as a result of the professions of faith on this day. Alternate translation: “in the community of believers grew to about 5,000” (2) “was,” and that would indicate that 5,000 men made professions of faith on this day. Alternate translation: “who put their faith in Jesus that day was about 5,000”
4:5	bzh0	207678	Introduction of a New Event [26833]	And it happened that	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a significant development in this story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose.
4:5	cdso	207679	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together	1	Luke is implicitly describing the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, which consisted of these three groups of people. Luke describes this council explicitly as “the Sanhedrin” in 4:15. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could identify it by name here. Alternate translation: “the Sanhedrin, consisting of their rulers and elders and scribes, was gathered together”
4:5	a9ir	207680	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	their rulers and elders and scribes	1	The pronoun **their** refers to the Jewish people. Alternate translation: “the rulers and elders and scribes of the Jewish people”
4:5	xnso	207681	Active or Passive [26672]	were gathered together	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “gathered together”
4:6	fnvj	207682	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas	1	Luke describes Annas as **the high priest**, but the actual situation was complicated. At this time the Romans were appointing the high priests for Judea. One Roman official had appointed Annas some years earlier, but ten years after that, another official deposed him and named his son-in-law Caiaphas high priest instead. However, the Jews still recognized Annas’ claim to the position. If you decide to clarify this for your readers, it would probably be best to state the matter as simply as possible. Alternate translation: “Annas, whom the Jews recognized as the high priest, and Caiaphas, whom a Roman official had appointed as the high priest”
4:6	f1fi	207683	How to Translate Names [26805]	Annas  &  Caiaphas,  &  John,  &  Alexander	1	These are the names of four men. The **John** mentioned here was a member of the high priest’s family. This is not the same John as the apostle.
4:6	nh28	207684		as many as were from the high priestly family	1	Alternate translation: “all the other members of the high priestly family who were members of the council”
4:7	s1ah	207685	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	having set them in {their} midst, they asked them	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter and John, and the pronouns **their** and **they** refer to the council members. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “when the council members had set Peter and John in their midst, the members asked them”
4:7	kkxz	207686	Doublet [26680]	By what power or in what name have you done this	1	The words **power** and **name** (meaning authority; see next note) mean similar things. The council members may be using them together to ask a comprehensive or emphatic question. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these terms in your translation. Alternate translation: “By whatever means were you able to do this?”
4:7	dg8d	207687	Metonymy [26707]	in what name	1	Here, **name** refers to authority. Alternate translation: “by what authority”
4:7	z4np	207688	Forms of ‘You’ — Dual/Plural [26733]	you	1	Since the council members are speaking to two men, **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. (All other pronouns in this account that refer to Peter and John would also be dual, such as **them** in its two instances in this verse.)
4:8	dzp6	207689	Active or Passive [26672]	Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. See how you translated the comparable expression in 2:4. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit filled Peter and he said”
4:8	kk2a	207690	Metaphor [26706]	Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said	1	Luke is speaking of Peter as if he were a container that the Holy Spirit **filled**. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit inspired Peter and he said”
4:8	bj8u	207691	Merism [26705]	Rulers of the people and elders	1	Peter is addressing the entire council by referring to its two components. Some of the members had ruling responsibilities. Others, the **elders**, were added to the council to bring its total membership up to 70, since according to Exodus 24:1, that was the number of elders who accompanied Moses when God confirmed the covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai. Alternate translation: “You members of the Sanhedrin”
4:8	qxz5	207692	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	of the people	1	Here, **the people** means specifically the people of Israel. Alternate translation: “of the people of Israel”
4:9	g9as	207693	Irony [26702]	if we are being questioned today concerning a good deed to a sick man, by what means he was made well	1	Peter is not suggesting seriously that the subject of the questioning is uncertain. He knows the subject, but he is suggesting ironically that it is uncertain so that he can describe it from his own perspective. The council asked by what power or authority he and John did “this,” implying that “this” was something bad, a public disturbance that troubled the authorities. In response, Peter asserts that “this” was instead something good, **a good deed to a sick man**. If it would be helpful to your readers, in your translation you could indicate the meaning that Peter is communicating through this irony. Alternate translation: “what we actually did was a good deed for a sick man, and if you want to know by what means he was made well”
4:9	g4ue	207694	Active or Passive [26672]	we are being questioned	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “you are questioning us”
4:9	g9n5	207695	Active or Passive [26672]	he was made well	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “he became healthy”
4:10	pqnz	207696	Third-Person Imperatives [26699]	let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “may this be known to you and to all the people of Israel” or “this should be known to you and to all the people of Israel”
4:10	yvvr	207697	Active or Passive [26672]	let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel	1	The word translated **known** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be clearer for your readers if you use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. The adjective **known** expresses the result of action by a different agent, so you can use an active form with that agent as the subject. Alternate translation: “you and all the people of Israel, know”
4:10	hbjp	207698	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	to you all	1	The pronoun **you** refers to the council members. Alternate translation: “to all of you council members” or “to all of you who are questioning us”
4:10	hchm	207699	Metonymy [26707]	in the name	1	Here, **name** refers to power and authority. Alternate translation: “through the power” or “by the authority”
4:10	ikvx	207700	How to Translate Names [26805]	of Jesus Christ the Nazarene	1	See how you translated this in 2:22 and 3:6. Alternate translation: “of Jesus Christ of Nazareth”
4:10	xh05	207701	Synecdoche [26729]	whom you crucified	1	It was the Romans who literally crucified Jesus, but Peter says that these Jewish leaders crucified him because their demands led to his death. See how you translated the similar expression in 2:23. Alternate translation: “whom you demanded to be crucified”
4:10	bnjp	207702	Idiom [26697]	whom God raised from the dead	1	As in 2:24, the idiom **raised up** means that God made Jesus alive again after he died. Alternate translation: “whom God made alive again after he died”
4:10	i1ju	207703	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	from the dead	1	Peter is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “from among those who have died”
4:11	aodj	207704	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	He	1	The pronoun **He** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus”
4:11	jopp	207705	Metaphor [26706]	the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner	1	Peter is quoting from Psalm 118:22, and the quotation contains a metaphor. This psalm is describing the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use. This means that people will reject him. When the psalm says that this stone became the cornerstone, this means that God will nevertheless make the Messiah the ruler of these people. However, since this is a quotation from Scripture, we recommend that you translate the words directly rather than providing a non-figurative explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text.
4:11	eu4n	207706	Active or Passive [26672]	that was rejected by you, the builders	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that you, the builders, rejected”
4:11	o3h2	207707	Idiom [26697]	the head of the corner	1	The phrase **the head of the corner** is an idiom that refers to a large stone with straight edges that builders would place down first and use as a reference to make sure that the walls of a stone building were straight and that the building was oriented in the right direction. Your language may have its own term for such a stone. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the cornerstone” or “the reference stone for the whole building”
4:12	t82r	207708	Double Negatives [26679]	there is no salvation in anyone else	1	In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “there is no salvation in no one else.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You could also state the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “he is the only one in whom there is salvation”
4:12	hye0	207709	Abstract Nouns [26671]	there is no salvation in anyone else	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **salvation**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “he is the only one who is able to save”
4:12	b4qz	207710	Active or Passive [26672]	there is no other name under heaven given	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God has not given any other name under heaven”
4:12	ktad	207711	Metonymy [26707]	there is no other name  &  by which we must be saved	1	Here, **name** represents a person by association with the way that each person has a name. Alternate translation: “there is no other person … by whom we must be saved”
4:12	liup	207712	Idiom [26697]	under heaven	1	This is an idiom. See how you translated it in 2:5. Alternate translation: “on earth”
4:12	s4zs	207713	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	among men	1	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “among people” or “to people”
4:12	cz99	207714	Active or Passive [26672]	by which we must be saved	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that can save us” or, if you translate “name” as “person,” “who can save us”
4:12	tynn	207715	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	we	1	Peter is using the word **we** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction.
4:13	vkfd	207716	Idiom [26697]	seeing	1	Luke is using the word **seeing** to mean that the council members noticed this and found it significant. Alternate translation: “taking note of” or “impressed with”
4:13	gb9e	207717	Abstract Nouns [26671]	the boldness of Peter and John	1	Here the abstract noun **boldness** refers to the way in which Peter and John responded to the Jewish leaders. If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the same idea with an adverb or an adjective. Alternate translation: “how boldly Peter and John had spoken” or “how bold Peter and John were”
4:13	qvin	207718	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	realizing	1	The implication is that the Jewish leaders realized this because of the way Peter and John spoke. Alternate translation: “realizing from the way they spoke”
4:13	jfte	207719	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	they marveled, and they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus	1	Here the pronoun **they** refers in its first two instances to the council members, and in its third instance it refers to Peter and John, as does the pronoun **them**. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this and to state the meaning here more concisely. Alternate translation: “the council members marveled, and they recognized that Peter and John had been with Jesus”
4:13	v7ox	207720	Doublet [26680]	they were uneducated and ordinary men	1	The words **uneducated** and **ordinary** mean similar things. Both words indicate that Peter and John had no formal education. Luke uses them together for emphasis, to express from the council members’ perspective how amazed they were. Alternate translation: “they had no formal education at all”
4:14	ijvs	207721	Active or Passive [26672]	the man who had been healed	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the man whom Peter and John had healed”
4:14	x0w5	207722	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter and John, and the pronoun **they** refers to the council members. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this. Alternate translation: “standing with Peter and John, the council members had nothing”
4:14	a7il	207723	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	they had nothing to say in opposition	1	The implication is that anything the council members said **in opposition** would have been in an attempt to discredit the claim that the man had been healed in the name of Jesus. But there was nothing they could say, since the evidence that the claim was true was right in front of them in the person of the formerly lame man standing on his own. Alternate translation: “they had nothing to say to discredit the account”
4:15	lrm4	207724	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	having commanded them to go outside the Sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves	1	The pronoun **them** refers at least to Peter and John, and probably also to the man who was healed, while the pronoun **they** refers to the council members. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this. Alternate translation: “having commanded Peter and John and the man who was healed to go outside the Sanhedrin, the council members conferred among themselves”
4:15	kzfb	207725	Metonymy [26707]	the Sanhedrin	1	Luke is using the name of the Jewish ruling council to mean the meeting place of that council. Alternate translation: “the place where the Sanhedrin met” or “the council chamber”
4:16	uciu	207726	Rhetorical Question [26724]	What should we do to these men	1	This could mean: (1) the Jewish leaders were using the question form to express their frustration because they realize that they cannot punish Peter and John. As 4:21 indicates explicitly, and as the leaders suggest here, they are afraid of how the people might respond if they do. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “It is very difficult to know what we should do to these men!” (2) the leaders were asking one another a genuine question, because ultimately they do decide to do something to Peter and John. They warn them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus, with an implied threat of punishment if they do. In that case it would be accurate to translate this as a question.
4:16	rgve	207727	Hyperbole [26695]	to everyone living in Jerusalem	1	This is a generalization that the leaders are making to emphasize how widely the news of the healing has spread. Alternate translation: “people who live throughout Jerusalem”
4:16	hv7x	207728		a notable sign	1	Here the word **sign** has the same sense that it has in the phrase “wonders and signs” in 2:22 and 2:43. It means a miracle. Alternate translation: “a remarkable miracle”
4:17	c97m	207729	Active or Passive [26672]	so that it may not be spread unto more	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “so that it does not spread” or “so that they will not spread it”
4:17	ygch	207730	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	so that it may not be spread unto more	1	By **it**, the council members do not mean the news of the man’s healing, since they have already said that everyone in Jerusalem knows about it. They mean the teaching that Jesus is Messiah, since they then try to prevent this from spreading by not allowing the apostles to speak to anyone about Jesus.

Alternate translation: “to stop speaking in this name to any of men”
4:17	g4pa	207734	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	to any of men	1	Here, **men** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “to any person” or “to anyone”

4:24	zq0r	207758	Collective Nouns [26738]	raised their voice	1	Since Luke is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **voice**. Alternate translation: “they raised their voices”

4:25	vlqu	207766	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	our	1	The believers are using the word **our** to refer to themselves but not to God, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

4:25	nsk0	207768		servant	1	The believers are using the word **servant** here in its ordinary sense, not as a title for the Messiah, so it would not be appropriate to translate it as “Messiah,” as you may have done when it was a title in 3:13 and 3:26.
4:25	mvdv	207769	Ellipsis [26681]	Why did the nations rage, and the peoples imagine useless things	1	Here some words have been left out that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete.

4:25	wf77	207770	Parallelism [26713]	Why did the nations rage, and the peoples imagine useless things?	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “David said that the kings of the earth had taken their stand and the rulers had gathered to the same against the Lord and against his Christ”
4:26	lihl	207774	Parallelism [26713]	The kings of the earth took their stand	1	In keeping with the conventions of Hebrew poetry, these two phrases mean basically the same thing. If the repetition might be confusing for your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “The kings of the earth took their stand, yes, the rulers were gathered to the same”
4:26	sd0g	207775	Idiom [26697]	The kings of the earth took their stand	1	The expression **took their stand** describes an army lining up for battle.

The word **hand**, meaning “power,” tells by what means God intended to carry out his **counsel**, that is, his plan. Alternate translation: “all that you planned in advance to make happen by your power”
4:28	lt70	207785	Personification [26716]	all that your hand and your counsel had predetermined to happen	1	The believers are speaking of God’s **hand** and his **counsel** (that is, his power and his plan) as if they had **predetermined** what would happen to Jesus.

5:1	ccjg	207830	Introduction of New and Old Participants [26835]	with Sapphira his wife	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce another new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation.

5:2	ale1	207832	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	he kept back from the price	1	The implication, as the story later makes clear, is that Ananias did not tell anyone except his wife that he was keeping some of the money for himself. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly, and you could state why he did this. Alternate translation: “he kept some of the money from the sale for himself, but he did not admit that he was doing that, because he wanted everyone to think he was being completely generous”
5:2	r6e5	207833		his} wife also knowing, and bringing a certain portion, he laid it	1	It may be helpful to make two new sentences here, particularly if you add information to the previous phrase as suggested in the preceding note. Alternate translation: “His wife also knew that he was keeping back part of the sale money. He brought a certain portion of the money and laid it”
5:2	birl	207834	Idiom [26697]	he laid it at the feet of the apostles	1	This means that he presented to money to the apostles. See how you translated the same expression in 4:37. Alternate translation: “he presented it to the apostles”
5:3	ptjy	207835	Rhetorical Question [26724]	why has Satan filled your heart for you to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back from the price of the land	1	Peter is using the question form to rebuke Ananias. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “you should not have let Satan fill your heart so that you lied to the Holy Spirit and kept back from the price of the land!”
5:3	ojl2	207836	Metaphor [26706]	why has Satan filled your heart	1	Peter is speaking of the **heart** of Ananias as if it were a container that Satan had **filled**. Alternate translation: “why have you allowed Satan to influence your heart so strongly”
5:3	zgen	207837	Metaphor [26706]	your heart	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Alternate translation: “your thoughts and motives”
5:3	nx93	207838	Order of Events [26683]	for you to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back from the price of the land	1	Ananais first withheld some of the money, then he lied to the Holy Spirit about this by pretending he was giving all of the money. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to describe the events in that order. Alternate translation: “for you to keep back from the price of the land and lie to the Holy Spirit”
5:3	z144	207839	Metonymy [26707]	for you to lie to the Holy Spirit	1	Ananias did not lie literally to the Holy Spirit, but he did lie to the apostles and to all of the believers who would have learned about his gift, and the Holy Spirit was present in them. So by lying to them, he was effectively also lying to the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “for you to lie to the Holy Spirit, who is present in us”
5:3	ysjh	207840	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	and to keep back from the price	1	The implication of what Peter says here is that Ananias claimed or pretended that he was giving the entire amount that he had received from selling his land. Alternate translation: “by pretending that you were giving us the entire amount when you had kept back some for yourself”
5:4	zg9p	207841	Rhetorical Question [26724]	While it remained, did it not remain yours, and being sold, was it {not} in your authority	1	Peter continues to use the question form to rebuke Ananias. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “While it remained, it remained yours, and after it was sold, it was still in your authority.”
5:4	rz8r	207842		While it remained	1	Alternate translation: “While it remained unsold” or “Before you sold it”
5:4	jxes	207843	Active or Passive [26672]	being sold	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “once you had sold it”
5:4	l4ts	207844	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	was it {  &  in your authority	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the money that Ananias received from the sale of the land. Alternate translation, as a statement: “you could still do whatever you wanted with the money you received”
5:4	ntre	207845	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	was it {  &  in your authority	1	The implications are that Ananias was not obligated to give all of the money to the apostles. He was free to keep some if he wished or if he needed it. He could simply have acknowledged that he was doing that, and giving the rest of the money would still have been a generous act because there was no compulsion. Alternate translation, as a statement: “you could have kept some and acknowledged that and you would have still been making a generous gift”
5:4	xvkr	207846	Rhetorical Question [26724]	How {is it} that you placed this thing in your heart	1	Peter continues to use the question form to rebuke Ananias. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation.

5:4	jtaf	207848	Metaphor [26706]	How {is it} that you placed this thing in your heart	1	Peter speaks of **this thing**, that is, the plan to keep back some of the money, as if Ananias had **placed** it in his **heart**, meaning his thoughts. Alternate translation, as an exclamation: “You should not even have thought of doing such a thing!”
5:4	f895	207849	Metonymy [26707]	You have not lied to men, but to God	1	Ananaias actually has **lied to men**, but Peter is speaking of the ultimate implications of his act. As in the previous verse, where Peter says that Ananias has lied to the Holy Spirit, here he means that Ananias has lied to the apostles and other believers, and God is present in them. So by lying to them, he has effectively also lied to God. Alternate translation: “You have not lied merely to men, but also to God, who is present in us”
5:4	f8r6	207850	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	to men	1	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense to mean “human beings.” Alternate translation: “to human beings”
5:5	nzth	207851	Metonymy [26707]	And hearing these words	1	Luke is using the term **words** to mean what Peter used words to say. Alternate translation: “When he heard what Peter said”
5:5	jdx2	207852	Euphemism [26682]	falling down, expired	1	The word translated **expired** means that Ananias “breathed out for the last time.” It is a mild way of saying that he died. Alternate translation: “fell down and died”
5:5	ogt7	207853	Order of Events [26683]	falling down, expired	1	Ananias fell down because he died. He did not die because he fell down. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to say first that he died and then that he fell. Alternate translation: “died and fell to the ground”
5:5	t9h0	207854	Personification [26716]	great fear came upon all the ones having heard	1	Luke describes this **fear** as if it were a living thing that could come onto people. Here the word **fear** describes a deep respect for God. Alternate translation: “everyone who heard about it came to feel a very deep respect for God”
5:6	hcif	207855	Idiom [26697]	So rising up, the young men wrapped him up	1	Here the expression **rising up** means that the young men took an action that they recognized they needed to take. It does not mean that they stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “the young men took action and wrapped him up”
5:6	tdzd	207856	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the young men	1	This could refer to: (1) some strong young men who were present who realized that burying Ananias was a task they could help with. Alternate translation: “some strong young men who were present” (2) a group of young men among the believers who regularly helped the apostles with tasks that required physical strength. Alternate translation: “the young men who regularly helped the apostles with physical tasks”
5:6	su3e	207857	Translate Unknowns [26822]	wrapped him up	1	It was the custom in this culture to wrap linen cloths around the bodies of people who had died, in order to prepare the bodies for burial. If your readers would not be familiar with such a custom, you could describe it more specifically, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “wrapped a linen burial cloth around his body” or “prepared his body for burial”
5:7	hg7t	207858	Idiom [26697]	And an interval of about three hours happened, and	1	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time passing. Your language may have its own way of describing that. Alternate translation: “After about three hours had gone by,”
5:7	ykf7	207859	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	his wife	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Ananias. Alternate translation: “the wife of Ananias” or “Sapphira”
5:7	reig	207860	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	what had happened	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what this means. Alternate translation: “that Peter had exposed their lie and that her husband was dead”
5:8	cxfp	207861		said to her	1	The word translated **said** means to continue or resume a conversation. Alternate translation: “asked her, based on what her husband had said”
5:8	arim	207862	Forms of ‘You’ — Dual/Plural [26733]	you sold	1	Since Peter is speaking of two people, Ananaias and Sapphira, **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural.
5:8	u0j9	207863	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	for so much.”  &  Yes, for so much	1	This refers to the amount of money that Ananias had given to the apostles. Peter may be naming the amount or, as UST suggests, he may be showing Sapphira the money. Alternate translation: “for this amount of money … yes, for that amount of money”
5:9	kutd	207864	Rhetorical Question [26724]	How {is it} that it was agreed together by you to test the Spirit of the Lord	1	Peter is using the question form to rebuke Sapphira. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord!”
5:9	i81v	207865	Active or Passive [26672]	it was agreed together by you	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “you agreed together”
5:9	pep0	207866	Forms of You [26731]	by you  &  your  &  you	1	The word **you** in its first instance refers to two people, Ananias and Sapphira, so it would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. The word **your** and the word **you** in its second instance refer only to Sapphira, so those words are singular.
5:9	lgse	207867		to test the Spirit of the Lord	1	Here the word **test** means to challenge. Ananias and Sapphira were trying to see if they could get away with lying about how much they received for the land they sold. Alternate translation: “to challenge the Spirit of the Lord”
5:9	ggza	207868	Metonymy [26707]	to test the Spirit of the Lord	1	Ananias and Sapphira actually tested or challenged the apostles, but Peter is speaking of the ultimate implications of their act, as he does similarly in 5:3 and 5:4. Since the Spirit of the Lord was present in the apostles, by challenging them, Ananias and Sapphira effectively lied to the Spirit. Alternate translation: “to test the Spirit of the Lord, who is present in us apostles”
5:9	iesf	207869	Metaphor [26706]	Behold, the feet	1	Peter says **Behold** to get Sapphira to focus her attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “And now the feet”
5:9	p6ae	207870	Metonymy [26707]	the feet of the ones having buried your husband {are} at the door	1	Peter is referring to the return of the young men who buried Ananaias. Their **feet** represent them by association with the way they are using their feet to walk back. The **door** represents their return by association with the way they will come through the door when they return. Alternate translation: “the young men who buried your husband are just now returning”
5:9	an4p	207871	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the feet of the ones having buried your husband {are} at the door	1	Peter is telling Sapphira implicitly that her husband died as a judgment from God when Peter confronted him with the lie about the price of the land. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your husband died as a judgment from God when I confronted him with the lie you both told about the price of the land, and the young men who buried him are just now returning”
5:9	y41n	207872	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	and they will carry you out	1	The implications are that Sapphira is also going to die and that the same young men will **carry** her **out** to bury her. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “You are also going to die as a judgment from God, and those same young men are going to carry you out and bury you”
5:10	ki5s	207873	Euphemism [26682]	she fell down at his feet and expired	1	The word translated **expired** means that Sapphira “breathed out for the last time.” It is a mild way of saying that she died. Alternate translation: “she fell down at his feet and died”
5:10	qimy	207874	Order of Events [26683]	she fell down at his feet and expired	1	Sapphira fell down because she died. She did not die because she fell down. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to say first that she died and then that she fell. Alternate translation: “she died and fell down at his feet”
5:10	mhpu	207875	Metonymy [26707]	she fell down at his feet	1	This means that she fell to the ground in front of Peter. This expression should not be confused with the idea of “falling down at a person’s feet,” that is, bowing down to the ground in front of someone as a sign of humility. Alternate translation: “she collapsed onto the ground in front of him”
5:10	ebsr	207876	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the young men	1	See how you translated this expression in 5:6. However, it may not be necessary to explain again here who these **young men** were in terms of their role in the community. Instead, you could identify them by their role in the story. Alternate translation: “the same young men who had buried Ananias”
5:11	fioh	207877	End of Story [26831]	And	1	This verse is the end of the story about Ananias and Sapphira. Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce information about what happened after the story as a result of the events within the story itself. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a story.
5:11	lbmm	207878	Personification [26716]	great fear came upon the whole church and upon all the ones hearing these things	1	Luke describes this **fear** as if it were a living thing that could come onto people. See how you translated the similar expression in 5:5. Alternate translation: “the whole church and everyone who heard about these things came to feel a very deep respect for God”
5:12	egaf	207879	Connect — Background Information [26746]	And	1	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce background information in 5:12–16 that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. You can translate this word with a word or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language. Alternate translation: “Now”
5:12	anun	207880	Metonymy [26707]	many signs and wonders were happening through the hands of the apostles	1	Luke is using the **hands** of the apostles to represent their actions. Alternate translation: “the apostles were doing many signs and wonders”
5:12	ksr5	207881	Doublet [26680]	signs and wonders	1	The terms **signs** and **wonders** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. See how you translated this expression in 4:30. Alternate translation: “great miracles”
5:12	y19s	207882	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	they were all	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the whole community of believers. Alternate translation: “the whole community of believers was”
5:12	h4qc	207883		unanimously	1	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. See how you translated the same expression in 1:14. Alternate translation: “meeting together with one accord” or “meeting together harmoniously”
5:12	xvg1	207884	How to Translate Names [26805]	the Porch of Solomon	1	This was a covered walkway that consisted of rows of pillars that supported a roof. It was named after King Solomon. See how you translated the phrase “the porch that is called Solomon’s” in 3:11, which is a description of this same walkway. Alternate translation: “Solomon’s Porch”
5:13	psoz	207885	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	none of the others	1	The expression **the others** refers to people who were not believers in Jesus. Alternate translation: “none of the people who were not believers in Jesus”
5:13	h7jh	207886	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	dared to join them	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly why no unbelievers **dared to join them**. The reason seems to be that the Jewish leaders had commanded the apostles not to speak or teach about Jesus (4:18), but they were still doing that. Later in this chapter, in 5:28, the Sanhedrin indicates that it has arrested the apostles for violating that command. Alternate translation: “would meet with them, because the apostles were still preaching about Jesus even though the Jewish leaders had commanded them not to do so”
5:14	jpgx	207887	Metonymy [26707]	were being added to the Lord	1	Luke says **the Lord** to mean the community of people who believed in the Lord. Alternate translation: “were being added to the church”
5:14	gwp3	207888	Active or Passive [26672]	were being added to the Lord	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. See how you translated the similar expression in 2:41. Alternate translation: “were becoming part of the church”
5:15	omnf	207890	Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship [26745]	so that	1	Luke says **so that** to introduce a result, but it is not the direct result of what he said just before, that many men and women became part of the church. It is the result of what he said in 5:12, that the apostles were doing “many signs and wonders.” All of 5:12–15 could be understood as a single sentence, and in that case what Luke says here would more clearly follow logically and grammatically from what he says in 5:12. However, ULT divides the material into several sentences, which is another way in which it can be understood. UST models a way to show how what Luke says here introduces a result of what he said in 5:12 about the “signs and wonders” that the apostles were doing.
5:15	fb4o	207891	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	they  &  carried	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the people who lived in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “people who lived in Jerusalem … carried”
5:15	o47u	207892	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	the sick	1	Luke is using the adjective **sick** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who were sick”
5:15	gqry	207893	Doublet [26680]	cots and mats	1	The words **cots** and **mats** mean similar things. Luke could be using them together for emphasis, although he could also be describing two different ways that people managed to make their sick relatives and friends reasonably comfortable as they waited in the streets for Peter to walk by. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these terms in your translation. Alternate translation: “improvised beds”
5:15	uc9c	207894	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	his} shadow might overshadow any one of them	1	The implication is that God was healing sick people whom Peter’s shadow touched. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “his shadow might overshadow any one of them and God would heal that person”
5:15	aa9x	207895		his} shadow might overshadow any one of them	1	Luke is using a construction in which the subject and verb come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have its own way of describing this. Alternate translation: “his shadow might fall on”
5:16	c48p	207896	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	the sick	1	See how you translated the expression **the sick** in 5:15. Alternate translation: “people who were sick”
5:16	pn93	207897	Active or Passive [26672]	those afflicted by unclean spirits	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “those whom unclean spirits were afflicting”
5:16	elj9	207898	Active or Passive [26672]	who were all healed	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “and the apostles healed them all” or “and God used the apostles to heal them all”
5:16	oeqy	207899	Hyperbole [26695]	who were all healed	1	It does not appear that **all** is a generalization for emphasis in this case. So it would not be accurate to treat **all** as figurative and say something like “and large numbers of them were healed.” Luke is describing what remarkable things God did through the apostles at this time, and he does seem to mean that every sick person whom the people brought to Jerusalem was healed. So it would be appropriate to say in your translation just what ULT says here.
5:17	s3sp	207900	Connect — Contrast Relationship [26743]	But	1	Luke uses the word **But** to introduce a strong contrast into the story. Your language may have its own way of introducing a contrasting narrative. You could also refer back to the previous action in order to highlight the contrast. Alternate translation: “But even though the apostles were doing so much good,”
5:17	k6v2	207901	Order of Events [26683]	rising up, the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy	1	The high priest and these Sadducees were first **filled with jealousy** and then they rose up (took action) against the apostles. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to describe the events in that order. Alternate translation: “the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy and they rose up”
5:17	o6kb	207902	Active or Passive [26672]	rising up, the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an active verbal form instead of the passive form **were filled**. Alternate translation: “jealousy filled the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) and they rose up”
5:17	zc37	207903	Idiom [26697]	rising up	1	Here the expression **rising up** means that the high priest decided to take action, not that he stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “taking action”
5:17	cr9s	207904	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees	1	The phrase **all those with him** means specifically all the other priests who joined the high priest in taking action against the apostles. Luke observes here that those other priests were from the group known as the **Sadducees**. As a note to 4:1 explains, they opposed the apostles’ teaching because they did not believe in the resurrection. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and all of the priests from the group known as the Sadducees who wanted to oppose the apostles’ teaching because they did not believe in the resurrection”
5:17	lhoy	207905	Abstract Nouns [26671]	were filled with jealousy	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **jealousy**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “jealous.” Alternate translation: “became very jealous”
5:17	hh9j	207906	Metaphor [26706]	were filled with jealousy	1	Luke is speaking as if the high priest and his allies were containers that jealousy **filled**. Alternate translation: “became very jealous”
5:18	bp23	207907	Metonymy [26707]	they laid hands on the apostles	1	The expression **laid hands on** means to arrest someone by association with the way that arresting officers might physically take hold of a person with their **hands**. Alternate translation: “they arrested the apostles”
5:18	sgp6	207908	Synecdoche [26729]	they laid hands on the apostles	1	The high priest and his allies did not arrest the apostles personally. They would have ordered the temple guards to arrest them. But Luke speaks as if the high priest and his allies did this action because they had a significant part in it by ordering it. Alternate translation: “they had the temple guards arrest the apostles”
5:19	aqi1	207909	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	bringing them out	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the apostles. Alternate translation: “bringing the apostles out”
5:20	ctqn	207910	Metonymy [26707]	in the temple	1	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so when the angel says **the temple** here, he means the courtyard associated with the temple. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard”
5:20	yiba	207911	Metonymy [26707]	all the words of this life	1	The angel is using the term **words** to mean the message that the apostles were to share by using words. Alternate translation: “the entire message about this life”
5:20	d19q	207912		of this life	1	Alternate translation: “about the everlasting life that God gives through Jesus” or “about the new way of living that people can have as followers of Jesus”
5:21	ahdt	207913	Idiom [26697]	having heard this	1	Luke may be using the word “hear” in an idiomatic sense to mean “obey.” Alternate translation: “in obedience to this command from the angel”
5:21	gvev	207914	Metonymy [26707]	into the temple	1	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so when Luke says **the temple** here, he means the courtyard associated with the temple. Alternate translation: “into the temple courtyard”
5:21	iw1e	207915	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	about daybreak	1	The implication is that although the angel led the apostles out of the jail during the night, the sun was rising by the time they reached the temple courtyard.

5:21	dr32	207917	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	having arrived	1	This does not mean that the high priest and his allies **arrived** in the temple courtyard where the apostles were. Rather, it means that they went into the chamber where the Sanhedrin met so that they could summon the rest of its members to join them there. Alternate translation: “having arrived in the council chamber”
5:21	plgj	207918	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the Sanhedrin, even all the elders of the sons of Israel	1	The phrase **even all the elders of the sons of Israel** clarifies the name **Sanhedrin** by describing it membership. Luke is using the word **elders** here in a general sense to mean “leaders.” He is not making a distinction between “elders” and “rulers” as he does in 4:5. Alternate translation: “the Sanhedrin, which was composed of the leaders of the sons of Israel”
5:21	moyf	207919	Metaphor [26706]	of the sons of Israel	1	Here, **sons** means “descendants.” Luke is identifying the Israelites as descendants of their ancestor Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel”
5:21	u2hc	207920	Ellipsis [26681]	sent to the prison	1	Luke is leaving out a word that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. He means that the high priest and his allies sent someone to the prison to get the apostles. Alternate translation: “sent someone to the prison”
5:23	v0v0	207921	Active or Passive [26672]	We found the prison shut in all security and the guards	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an active verbal form in place of the passive form **shut**, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “We found that the guards had shut the prison in all security and we found the guards”
5:23	s86t	207922	Abstract Nouns [26671]	in all security	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **security**, you could express the same idea with an adverb such as “securely.” The word **all** is an intensifier. Alternate translation: “very securely”
5:23	x7s0	207923	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	having opened	1	Your language may require you to specify the object of **opened**. Alternate translation: “once we opened the doors”
5:23	e0x0	207924	Hyperbole [26695]	we found no one inside	1	By **no one**, the officers mean that they found none of the men they had been sent to bring, that is, none of the apostles. It is possible that other people were also being held in the prison, but the angel would not have released them, and they would still have been inside. Alternate translation: “we did not find any of those men inside”

5:24	cuxr	207927	Idiom [26697]	as to what this might become	1	The expression **what this might become** refers to a possible result. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “wondering what would happen as a result”
5:25	rggb	207928	Metaphor [26706]	Behold, the men	1	This person says **Behold** to get the council members to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “Right now the men”
5:25	lm01	207929	Forms of You [26731]	you put	1	Here the word **you** refers to the captain of the temple and the chief priests and so it is plural.
5:25	ook6	207930	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	standing in the temple	1	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so when the messenger says **the temple** here, he means the courtyard associated with the temple. Alternate translation: “standing in the temple courtyard”
5:26	ek6i	207931	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	Then the captain, going with the officers, brought them back, not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they stone them	1	The first instance of the pronoun **them** refers to the apostles, but the second instance of the pronoun **them** refers to the captain and the officers. The captain and officers were not afraid that the people would stone the apostles. They were afraid that they would be stoned themselves if they used violence against the apostles. You could reword this to make the referents clear. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “Then the captain went with the officers and brought the apostles back. But the captain and officers did not use any violence, because they were afraid that the people would stone them if they did”
5:27	vwnn	207932	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	And having brought them	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the apostles in all three instances in this verse. It may be helpful to specify this here in the first instance. Alternate translation: “Once they had brought the apostles back”
5:28	ljya	207933		We commanded you with a command	1	For emphasis, the high priest is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. If your language uses the same construction for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use it here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of conveying this emphasis. Alternate translation: “we commanded you very strictly”
5:28	eyg7	207934	Forms of You [26731]	you  &  you have filled  &  your  &  you desire	1	In this verse the words **you** and **your** refer to the apostles, and so those words are plural.
5:28	vewf	207935	Metonymy [26707]	in this name	1	The high priest is using the term **name** to mean the person of Jesus. See how you translated the similar expression in 4:17. Alternate translation: “about this person Jesus”

5:28	iz9t	207938	Metaphor [26706]	you desire to bring upon us	1	The high priest is speaking as if the apostles wanted to put the blood of Jesus on him and his fellow Jewish leaders. Alternate translation: “you want to make us responsible for”
5:28	z9t5	207939	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	us	1	By **us**, the high priest means himself and his fellow Jewish leaders, but not the apostles to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
5:28	thx4	207940	Metonymy [26707]	the blood	1	The high priest is using the term **blood** to mean death by association with the way Jesus’ blood was shed when he died. Alternate translation: “the death”

5:29	thju	207942	Hendiadys [26694]	answering, Peter and the apostles said	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Peter and the other apostles responded to the high priest. Alternate translation: “Peter and the apostles responded”

5:30	jzf5	207946	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	of our fathers	1	Although the term **fathers** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could state “of our fathers and mothers” to indicate this.
5:30	hakn	207947	Idiom [26697]	raised up Jesus	1	As in 2:24, the idiom **raised up** means that God made Jesus alive again after he died. Alternate translation: “brought Jesus back to life”
5:30	yy12	207948	Forms of You [26731]	whom you killed	1	The word **you** is plural. Even though Peter is responding to the high priest, who has been interrogating the apostles, Peter is referring here to the entire council. If your language does not use separate forms for singular and plural “you,” you could indicate that in some other way. Alternate translation: “whom you Sanhedrin members killed”
5:30	cdoj	207949	Synecdoche [26729]	whom you killed	1	It was the Romans who literally killed Jesus, but Peter says that the Sanhedrin members killed him because their demands led to his death. Alternate translation: “whom you demanded to be killed”
5:30	knik	207950	Metonymy [26707]	having hung him on a tree	1	The word translated **tree** can mean either an actual tree or something made of wood. Peter is using the word to refer to the cross, which was made out of wood. Alternate translation: “having hung him on a wooden cross”
5:30	wo2y	207951	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	having hung him on a tree	1	In some languages the word **hung** would suggest a different method of execution. For clarity, you could use a different word that might indicate the actual meaning better. Alternate translation: “having suspended him from a wooden cross”
5:31	pp9o	207952	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	this one	1	Peter is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Jesus. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.)

5:31	itf8	207953	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	to his right	1	Peter is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate the right side. See how you translated the similar expression in 2:25. Alternate translation: “to his right side”

5:31	dwu1	207955	Abstract Nouns [26671]	to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **repentance** and **forgiveness**, you could express the same ideas with verbs. Alternate translation: “to give the people of Israel an opportunity to repent and have God forgive their sins”
5:31	gjqt	207956	Metonymy [26707]	to Israel	1	Here, **Israel** represents the people who belong to the nation of Israel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel”
5:32	lidw	207957	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	we	1	Peter is addressing the Sanhedrin, but he is using the word **we** to refer only to himself and the other apostles. So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “us,” it would be accurate to use the exclusive form here. Other languages may have other ways of indicating that **we** is exclusive here. Alternate translation: “we apostles”
5:32	o3ob	207958	Ellipsis [26681]	and the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those obeying him	1	Peter is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete.

5:32	h211	207959	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	whom God has given to those obeying him	1	Here at the end of his response to the high priest, Peter is echoing what he said at the beginning: “It is necessary to obey God rather than men.” He is defining himself and his fellow apostles as people who are committed to obeying God and to testifying about Jesus even if the authorities forbid them to do that. Peter is saying that God has given the apostles the Holy Spirit to empower them to give that testimony in obedience to him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “whom God has given us to empower us to obey him by testifying about Jesus”
5:33	sj4z	207960	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	having heard this, they were furious and wanted to kill them	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the council members and the pronoun **them** refers to the apostles.

In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. It may be helpful to do that in a separate sentence, as UST does.
5:34	xswh	207964	Active or Passive [26672]	honored by all the people	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “whom all the people honored”

He means “be very careful about what you do to these men,” and you could state that as an alternate translation. However, the implication is that the council should not kill the apostles, as 5:33 says they want to do. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly.

5:38	ir1f	207989		And now I say these things to you	1	Gamaliel uses this expression to shift the council members’ attention away from the stories of Theudas and Judas so that he could give them some direct advice.

6:2	o2uq	208016	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	the  &  Twelve	1	Luke is using the adjective **Twelve** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people, the apostles who led the church.

6:2	b18i	208017	How to Translate Names [26805]	the  &  Twelve	1	Alternatively, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns, you may be able to do that in this case, since this is a title by which the apostles were known. Even though it is a number, if you translate it as a title, as ULT does, follow the conventions for titles in your language. For example, capitalize main words and write out numbers rather than use digits.
6:2	fk3j	208018	Metaphor [26706]	to leave behind the word of God	1	The apostles are speaking as if they would walk away from the **word of God** and **leave** it **behind** them. Alternate translation: “to stop preaching and teaching the word of God”

6:6	otf6	208034	Symbolic Action [26816]	they placed their hands upon them	1	The apostles **placed their hands** on the seven men to show publicly that they were giving them the responsibility and authority to oversee the food distribution. Alternate translation: “and placed their hands on them to show that they were giving them responsibility and authority”
6:7	pq41	208035	End of Story [26831]		1	As the outline in the General Introduction indicates, this verse is the end of the first major section of the book of Acts.

6:7	msqa	208039	Abstract Nouns [26671]	became obedient to the faith	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **faith**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “believe.” Alternate translation: “came to believe in Jesus and so started obeying his teachings”
6:8	cojb	208040	Introduction of New and Old Participants [26835]	Now Stephen	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce Stephen as the main character in this part of the story. Your language may have its own way of doing that. If so, you could use it here in your translation.
6:8	gd8a	208041	Metaphor [26706]	Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing	1	Luke is speaking as if Stephen were a container that **grace and power** were filling. Alternate translation: “Stephen had abundant grace and power, and so he was doing”
6:8	ecc7	208042	Hendiadys [26694]	Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing	1	Luke may be using the two words **grace** and **power** together to express a single idea.

6:8	or7t	208043	Abstract Nouns [26671]	Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **grace** and **power**, you could express the same ideas with adverbs.

6:9	kjqo	208045	Idiom [26697]	there arose	1	Here the expression **rose up** means that these people took action, specifically to oppose Stephen, not that they stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “took action to oppose Stephen”

6:10	p5dx	208050	Hendiadys [26694]	the wisdom and the Spirit by whom he spoke	1	Luke may be using the two words **wisdom** and **Spirit** together to express a single idea. The word **Spirit** would describe the source and character of the **wisdom** that Stephen was displaying. The word **Spirit** refers to the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “the Spirit-inspired wisdom by which he spoke” or “the wisdom that the Holy Spirit gave him as he spoke”
6:10	j178	208051	Abstract Nouns [26671]	the wisdom and the Spirit by whom he spoke	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **wisdom**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “the wise things he said as the Spirit inspired him”
6:11	jvc3	208052	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	they bribed men to say	1	The word **instigated** means that Stephen’s opponents in some way persuaded these men to lie about what Stephen was saying. They may have offered them money, or they may have convinced them that Stephen was a dangerous person who needed to be stopped. Since Luke does not specify the means, it may be best not to suggest a means in your translation. But it would be appropriate to indicate that what these men were recruited to say about Stephen was a lie. Alternate translation: “recruited some men to lie about Stephen by saying”
6:11	k91u	208053	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	We have heard	1	The men are using the word **We** to refer only to themselves, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

6:13	gvsr	208057	Double Negatives [26679]	does not stop speaking	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **stop**. Alternate translation: “continually speaks”
6:13	k705	208058	Metonymy [26707]	speaking words	1	The men are using the term **words** to mean things that Stephen has been saying by using words. Alternate translation: “saying things”

6:14	j1e0	208061	Metonymy [26707]	the customs that Moses handed down to us	1	The phrase **handed down** is an idiom that refers to something that is passed from generation to generation.

Alternate translation: “the customs that our ancestors learned from Moses and have taught each successive generation”
6:15	ojni	208062	Simile [26728]	saw his face as the face of an angel	1	Luke offers this comparison but he does not say specifically in what way Stephen’s face was like **the face of an angel**. However, this may mean that his face was shining brightly, since descriptions of angels in the Bible often say they were shining brightly. So you might choose to say that in your translation. Alternate translation: “saw that his face was shining brightly, like the face of an angel”
7:1	keoi	208063	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the high priest	1	Connecting Statement:\n\nLuke assumes that his readers will know that **the high priest** was there and that he asked Stephen to testify because he was a member of the Sanhedrin and its leader. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the high priest, who was the leader of the Sanhedrin,”
7:2	dqvx	208064	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	Then he said	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Stephen, not the high priest. Alternate translation: “Then Stephen said”

Alternate translation: “My fellow Israelites and you leaders of Israel”
7:2	emz8	208067	Abstract Nouns [26671]	The God of glory	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **glory** with an adjective such as “glorious.” Alternate translation: “The glorious God” or “God, who is glorious,” or see the next note for a further possibility.
7:2	fr3f	208068	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	The God of glory	1	Stephen apparently chooses to describe God in this way at the beginning of his speech in order to refute the charge made in 6:11 that he says blasphemous things about God. Calling him the **God of glory** acknowledges that people should rightfully give glory to God. You might choose to bring out this implication in your translation. Alternate translation: “God, to whom we should rightfully give glory,”
7:2	ft70	208069	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	our	1	Here and throughout this chapter, Stephen is using the word **our** to refer to himself and to his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction.

7:3	ka6b	208071	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	he said to him, ‘Go out from your land and from your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this verse so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “God told Abraham to go out from his land and from his relatives and come into the land that he would show him”
7:3	t7jm	208072	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	he said to him	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God, while the pronoun **him** refers to Abraham. Alternate translation: “God said to Abraham”

For clarity, in your translation you might say “Abraham lived” and “God brought him.”
7:4	ilkb	208074	Forms of You [26731]	you	1	The word **you** is plural. Stephen is using it to refer not just to the high priest, whose question he is answering, but also to all of the council members and the others who are listening to him. So you can use the plural form of the word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
7:5	g6yb	208075	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	he did not give him  &  he promised  &  to him  &  his  &  him—although he did not have	1	The pronouns **him** and **his** and the third instance of **he** refer to Abraham, while the first two instances of **he** refer to God.

7:5	ntwa	208076		he did not give him an inheritance in it	1	Alternate translation: “he did not give any of it to him as an inheritance”
7:5	flmo	208077	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	not even a footstep	1	This could mean: (1) not enough ground to stand on or (2) not enough ground on which to take a step.

7:5	yg31	208079	Abstract Nouns [26671]	to him for a possession, and to his seed after him	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **possession** with a verb such as “possess.” Stephen is saying that Abraham possessed the land in the sense that it was something that God had promised to him but that it was his descendants who came into actual possession of it. Alternate translation: “as something that his descendants would one day possess”
7:6	iz3g	208080	Direct and Indirect Quotations [26719]	But God spoke to him like this, that his seed would be a stranger in a foreign land, and that they would enslave him and treat him badly for 400 years	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here.

7:6	v76e	208081	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	God spoke to him like this	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that this occurred some time after the statement in the previous verse.

7:6	qh90	208082	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	his seed would be a stranger in a foreign land, and that they would enslave him and treat him badly	1	Stephen is using the singular word **seed** to mean “descendants,” and so he uses the singular noun **stranger** and the singular pronoun **him**. For clarity in your translation, to show that he is not referring to a single individual, you could state “descendants” and “strangers” and use the plural pronoun **them**. Alternate translation: “his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land, whose people would enslave them and treat them badly”
7:7	sjp1	208083	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	But I will judge the nation that will enslave him,’ said God, ‘and after that they will come out and serve me in this place	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But God said that he would judge the nation that would enslave him and that after that they would come out and serve him in this place”
7:7	gjbq	208084	Metonymy [26707]	the nation	1	Here, **nation** refers to the people who belong to that nation. Alternate translation: “the people of the nation”
7:7	gdcy	208085	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	will enslave him	1	As in 7:6, Stephen is using the singular pronoun **him** because he is using the singular word **seed** to mean “descendants.” For clarity, particularly if you said “descendants” in the previous verse, you could use the plural pronoun “them” instead. That would help readers recognize that Stephen also means Abraham’s descendants when he says “they” later in the verse. Alternate translation: “will enslave them”
7:8	rylq	208086	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	he gave him  &  he fathered	1	The first instance of the pronoun **he** refers to God, while the word **him** and the second instance of the pronoun **he** refer to Abraham.

7:8	yb4o	208087	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	he gave him the covenant of circumcision	1	Stephen’s listeners would have known that this **covenant** required Abraham to circumcise the males of his family.

7:8	xpsk	208089	Ellipsis [26681]	and Isaac, Jacob; and Jacob, the 12 patriarchs	1	Stephen is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete.

7:9	y2a8	208091	Kinship [26799]	the patriarchs	1	Here the word **patriarchs** refers to the older sons of Jacob in their relationship with Joseph. If you refer to them in your translation as Joseph’s brothers, use the word for an older brother if your language makes that distinction. Alternate translation: “Jacob’s older sons” or “Joseph’s older brothers”
7:9	o4w3	208092	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	sold him into Egypt	1	Stephen’s listeners would have known that this meant that their ancestors sold Joseph into slavery and that he was taken to Egypt to be a slave there.

7:10	n3n0	208095	Abstract Nouns [26671]	he gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **favor** and **wisdom** with adjectives. Alternate translation: “God made Pharaoh favorable towards Joseph and enabled Joseph to give Pharaoh wise advice”
7:10	cnz9	208096	Idiom [26697]	before Pharaoh	1	Here the phrase **before Pharaoh** may be an idiom that means “in the presence of.” Alternate translation: “whenever he was in the presence of Pharaoh” or see next note for another possibility.
7:10	cjqh	208097	Metonymy [26707]	before Pharaoh	1	The phrase **before Pharaoh** could also refer to Pharaoh’s opinion by association with the way that Pharaoh would assess anything that came to his attention in front of him. Alternate translation: “in Pharaoh’s perspective”

7:11	xo2f	208101	Personification [26716]	came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great tribulation	1	Here, Stephen speaks of **famine** and **tribulation** as if they **came** to Egypt and Canaan on their own. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “there was a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and there was great tribulation”
7:11	cxr4	208102	Abstract Nouns [26671]	and great tribulation	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **tribulation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and people suffered greatly”

7:12	jw02	208105	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	sent our fathers first	1	By **first**, Stephen does not mean that Jacob sent Joseph’s older brothers to Egypt before he sent anyone else, or before he did anything else. He means that Jacob sent them for a first time and would later send them for a second time, as Stephen’s listeners would have understood. Alternate translation: “he sent our fathers on a first trip there to buy food”
7:12	vk5w	208106	Metaphor [26706]	our fathers	1	Stephen is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” Here he means specifically Joseph’s older brothers, as UST indicates. Alternate translation: “our ancestors”
7:13	ljb5	208107	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	during the second {time	1	Stephen is using the adjective **second** as a noun, to mean the second time that Joseph’s brothers went to Egypt. ULT adds **time** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “when Jacob sent them to Egypt again to buy more food”
7:13	gv8p	208108	Ordinal Numbers [26807]	during the second {time	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “during trip number two” or “on their next trip”

7:13	e035	208110	Active or Passive [26672]	the family of Joseph became known to Pharaoh	1	The phrase **became known** is not actually a passive form in Greek, but it might sound like one in other languages. If your language does not use passive forms, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Pharaoh learned that they were Joseph’s family”
7:14	qmpu	208111	Connect — Goal (Purpose) Relationship [26744]	sending them back, Joseph summoned Jacob	1	Stephen means that Joseph sent his brothers back home in order to get their father Jacob. Alternate translation: “Joseph sent his brothers back to Canaan to get Jacob”
7:14	gb24	208112	Idiom [26697]	in souls 75	1	Stephen is using a Hebrew idiom here. Alternate translation: “who amounted to 75 people”
7:15	ootx	208113	Idiom [26697]	Jacob went down to Egypt	1	Stephen says that Jacob **went down** because he traveled from the hilly and mountainous terrain of Canaan to the lowlying land of Egypt. Alternate translation: “Jacob traveled to Egypt”
7:15	a9l3	208114	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	he and our fathers died	1	Stephen’s listeners would have known that Jacob and his sons lived in Egypt for some time. Make sure that your translation does not make it sound as if they **died** as soon as they arrived in Egypt. Alternate translation: “eventually Jacob and our ancestors died”
7:15	m6x4	208115	Metaphor [26706]	he and our fathers	1	Stephen is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” Here he means specifically Jacob’s sons (Joseph’s older brothers), as UST indicates. Alternate translation: “Jacob and his sons who became our ancestors”
7:16	kehg	208116	Active or Passive [26672]	they were carried over to Shechem and laid	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

7:16	hd6g	208117	Metonymy [26707]	for a price in silver	1	Stephen is referring to money by association with the way, in this culture, people used **silver** as money.

7:17	oydg	208118	Order of Events [26683]	And as the time of the promise  &  approached, the people increased and multiplied	1	In your language it may be helpful to say that the people **increased and multiplied** before saying that **the time of the promise** approached. Alternate translation: “the people increased and multiplied in Egypt as the time of the promise … approached”
7:17	xs7n	208119	Personification [26716]	as the time of the promise that God had sworn to Abraham approached	1	Stephen is speaking of this **time** as if it were a person and could have **approached** on its own. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “when it was almost time for God to fulfill the promise he had sworn to Abraham”
7:17	nh7t	208120	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	as the time of the promise that God had sworn to Abraham approached	1	Stephen is referring to **the promise** that he described in 7:7. God promised Abraham that he would deliver his descendants from a nation that would enslave them and that he would bring them back to the land of Canaan. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “as the time approached of the promise that God had sworn to Abraham, that he would deliver his descendants from slavery and bring them back to Canaan,”
7:17	v2dj	208121	Hendiadys [26694]	the people increased and multiplied	1	Stephen is using the two words **increased** and **multiplied** together to express a single idea. The word **multiplied** tells in what way the people **increased**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “the people increased greatly”
7:18	ojnv	208122	Metaphor [26706]	another king arose over Egypt	1	When Stephen says that this next king **arose**, he is using a spatial metaphor to mean that this king began his reign. Alternate translation: “another king began to rule over Egypt”

7:18	edcd	208124	Metonymy [26707]	who did not know Joseph	1	Stephen is not saying that this king **did not know Joseph** personally. Joseph had been dead for centuries by this point. Rather, **Joseph** refers to the reputation of Joseph. Alternate translation: “who did not know that Joseph had helped Egypt”
7:19	wnxc	208125	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	He	1	**He** refers to the new king of Egypt, not to Joseph. Alternate translation: “This king”
7:19	ls54	208126	Metaphor [26706]	our} fathers	1	Here and frequently throughout the rest of his speech to the Sanhedrin, Stephen is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If your readers might not understand this, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “our ancestors”
7:19	bjdr	208127	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	our} fathers	1	Although the term **fathers** is masculine, when Stephen uses it to mean “ancestors,” it has a generic sense that includes both men and women. Here and throughout the speech, if you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could state “our fathers and mothers” to indicate this generic sense.
7:19	t3yu	208128	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	to make their babies exposed,  &  them	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that by **exposed** he means “left outside.” This was an unfortunate means of infanticide in the ancient world. Alternate translation: “forcing them to leave their babies outside”
7:19	wxl7	208129	Double Negatives [26679]	in order not to keep  &  alive	1	Stephen is using a double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the verb **keep alive**, which was negative from Pharaoh’s perspective, since it was contrary to his intentions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “in order to kill them”
7:20	x4i9	208130	Connect — Simultaneous Time Relationship [26748]	At that time	1	Stephen uses this phrase to introduce something that happened while Pharaoh was trying to kill the Israelite babies. Alternate translation: “While this was happening,”

7:20	qy2h	208132	Active or Passive [26672]	Moses was born	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the birth of Moses took place”
7:20	yx4u	208133	Idiom [26697]	he was beautiful to God	1	This could mean: (1) that Moses was **beautiful** in God’s perspective. Alternate translation: “God considered him to be beautiful” (2) in an idiiom, that Moses was very **beautiful**. Alternate translation: “he was very beautiful”
7:20	fksv	208134	Active or Passive [26672]	He was raised  &  in the house of {his} father	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, you could make Moses’ parents the subject. Alternate translation: “his parents cared for him … in their home”
7:21	bxdf	208135	Active or Passive [26672]	But when he was exposed	1	Moses **was exposed** because of Pharaoh’s command. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, the context suggests that it was Moses’ parents. Alternate translation: “when his parents had to place him outside”
7:21	u6tm	208136	Metaphor [26706]	took him up	1	This could mean: (1) that Pharaoh’s daughter adopted Moses. The verb can have this figurative legal meaning. Alternate translation: “adopted him” (2) that she lifted him up out of the basket he was in on the banks of the Nile. (This story is told in Exodus 2:1–10.) Alternate translation: “rescued him”
7:22	kq4x	208137	Active or Passive [26672]	Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

7:23	nq38	208140	Idiom [26697]	when a 40-year time was filled to him	1	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “after Moses had turned forty”
7:23	esu8	208141	Active or Passive [26672]	when a 40-year time was filled to him	1	Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” and use an active verbal form instead of the passive form. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here.
7:23	hux5	208142	Idiom [26697]	it came up on his heart	1	The expression **it came up on his heart** means that Moses felt a desire. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he felt a desire”
7:23	pk99	208143	Metonymy [26707]	it came up on his heart	1	Here, **heart** is a metonym for the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “he felt a desire”

7:23	vx57	208145	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	his brothers, the sons of Israel	1	Although the terms **brothers** and **sons** are masculine, Stephen is using these words in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you decide to retain the metaphor in your translation, you could state “brothers and sisters” and “sons and daughters” to indicate this.
7:24	fjkj	208146	Active or Passive [26672]	seeing a certain one being mistreated	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was **the Egyptian** who is mentioned later in the verse. Alternate translation: “seeing an Egyptian mistreating an Israelite”
7:24	jxy3	208147	Active or Passive [26672]	made vengeance for the one being oppressed, striking the Egyptian	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

7:24	iv6r	208148	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	striking the Egyptian	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that Moses hit **the Egyptian** so hard that he died.

7:25	pcp6	208150	Abstract Nouns [26671]	was giving salvation to them	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **salvation**, you could express the same idea in another way. In context, the word refers to God using Moses to deliver the Israelites from slavery. Alternate translation: “was delivering them from slavery”
7:25	swz9	208151	Metonymy [26707]	by his hand	1	Here, **hand** refers to the actions of Moses. Alternate translation: “through his actions”
7:26	a811	208152	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	to them	1	It is clear from the context that these were two Israelite men, though Stephen does not say that specifically. Alternate translation: “to two Israelite men”
7:26	ozje	208153	Forms of ‘You’ — Dual/Plural [26733]	to them  &  them  &  you are  &  you are hurting	1	Since Moses is speaking to two people, these uses of **them** and **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, they would be plural.
7:26	z5jk	208154	Abstract Nouns [26671]	he urged them to peace	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “he urged them to stop fighting”
7:26	kbf2	208155	Quotes within Quotes [26721]		1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “telling them that they were brothers and asking them why they were hurting each other”

7:26	mtli	208158	Rhetorical Question [26724]	Why is it that you are hurting each other	1	Moses is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You should not be hurting each other!”
7:27	rl75	208159	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	him	1	The word **him** refers to Moses, not to the neighbor. Alternate translation: “Moses”
7:27	oiqd	208160	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	saying, ‘Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “asking him who appointed him a ruler and a judge over them”
7:27	aza9	208161	Rhetorical Question [26724]	Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us	1	The man is using a rhetorical question to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “No one appointed you a ruler and judge over us!”
7:27	rrbi	208162	Doublet [26680]	a ruler and a judge	1	In this context, the words **ruler** and **judge** mean basically the same thing. The man is using repetition to emphasize the fact that he feels that Moses has no authority over them. If your language does not use repetition for such a purpose, you could use a single phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “an authority with power”
7:27	pqxe	208163	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	us	1	The man is using the word **our** to refer to himself and to his neighbor, but not to Moses, so use the exclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction.
7:28	o1up	208164	Double Negatives [26679]	You do not want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you	1	The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **do you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Do you want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday”
7:28	faid	208165	Rhetorical Question [26724]	You do not want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you	1	The man is using a rhetorical question implicitly to threaten Moses by indicating that he and probably others knew that Moses had killed the Egyptian.

Alternate translation: “I suppose you want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday!”
7:28	icoo	208166	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	You do not want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation.

7:29	occs	208168	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	Moses ran away at this word	1	The implication is that Moses fled because he recognized that these Israelites, and probably others, knew that he had killed an Egyptian. Moses feared that he would be punished or even killed for this crime. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Moses ran away at this word to try to escape from being punished”
7:29	mt3i	208169	Metonymy [26707]	at this word	1	Stephen is using the term **word** to mean what the man said by using words. Alternate translation: “at this statement”
7:29	ihog	208170	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	where he fathered two sons	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that Moses married a Midianite woman when he fled from Egypt.

7:30	nh5a	208172	Active or Passive [26672]	40 years having been filled	1	Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” and use an active verbal form instead of the passive form. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here.
7:30	ug9g	208173	Idiom [26697]	an angel appeared to him	1	The word **appeared** does not mean that Moses simply saw this angel in a vision. Rather, this expression indicates that the angel was actually present with Moses. Alternate translation: “suddenly an angel was there with Moses”
7:30	wd80	208174	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	an angel appeared to him	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners know that God came to speak with Moses through the **angel**. The UST makes this explicit.
7:31	et27	208175	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	admired the sight	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that Moses **admired the sight** because the bush was not burning up, even though it was on fire. Alternate translation: “marveled at what he saw, because the fire was not consuming the bush”
7:31	gw2n	208176	Personification [26716]	the voice of the Lord came	1	Stephen is speaking of **the voice of the Lord** as if it were a person and that it **came** on its own.

Alternate translation: “The Lord told Moses that he was the God of his fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob”
7:33	wlxa	208178	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	the Lord said to him, ‘Untie the sandal of your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “the Lord told Moses to untie the sandals that were on his feet, because the place on which he was standing was holy ground”
7:33	e86k	208179	Symbolic Action [26816]	Untie the sandal of your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground	1	In this culture, removing footwear was a symbolic way of acknowledging that a place was sacred. Footwear that had been worn elsewhere should not touch it. Your readers may understand the symbolic meaning of this action. If not, you could explain it in your translation. Alternate translation: “Untie your sandals and remove them to acknowledge that the place on which you are standing is holy ground”
7:33	gud1	208180	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	Untie the sandal of your feet	1	The implication is that God wanted Moses not only to untie his sandals but also to remove them. Alternate translation: “Untie your sandals and remove them from your feet”
7:33	pwmr	208181	Collective Nouns [26738]	the sandal of your feet	1	Since this refers to both sandals, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **sandals**. If your language uses the dual form, it would be appropriate to use that here. Alternate translation: “the sandals on your feet” or “the sandals you are wearing”
7:33	iryh	208182	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	for the place on which you are standing is holy ground	1	The implication is that where God is present, the immediate area around God is considered or made **holy** by God.

And now come, let me send you to Egypt	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “The Lord said that he had certainly seen the oppression of his people who were in Egypt and that he had heard their groaning and that he had come down to rescue them. He told Moses to get ready because he was sending him to Egypt”
7:34	xxum	208184	Idiom [26697]	I have certainly seen	1	Stephen is reproducing a Hebrew idiom from the biblical account of Moses at the burning bush. The verb **seen** is repeated in Hebrew. This repetition expresses the intensity, certainty, or clarity of Yahweh’s having seen how his people were being oppressed. This Hebrew practice of verb repetition for intensification cannot be directly translated into English. Use a natural form of strengthening a verb from your language.
7:34	z54j	208185	Possession [26717]	of my people	1	God uses the possessive word **my** to emphasize that these people were in a covenant relationship with him based on his promises to their ancestors. Alternate translation: “of the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob”

7:34	bncf	208189	Statements — Other Uses [26677]	let me send you to Egypt	1	God is not asking Moses’ permission when he says **let me send you to Egypt**. This is a way of saying “I will send you to Egypt,” and that statement in turn is functioning as a command. Alternate translation: “you must go to Egypt”
7:35-38	y2x6	208190	Litany [26703]	This Moses	1	Verses 35, 36, 37, and 38 contains a series of similar phrases emphasizing the role of Moses. Stephen says **This Moses**, “This one,” “This is the Moses,” and “This is the one.” If possible, use similar statements in your own translation to emphasize Moses.

For this Moses, who brought us from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation.

7:40	y2zv	208213		saying to Aaron	1	It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They said to Aaron”
7:40	jogm	208214	Information Structure [26700]	For this Moses, who brought us from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him	1	It may be more natural to put the information about Moses at the end of the sentence.

7:42	uwqa	208221	Active or Passive [26672]	it is written in the book of the prophets	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

7:42	ajuq	208223	Quote Markings [26720]	You did not offer slain beasts and offerings to me	1	This is the beginning of a quotation from the prophet Amos, which continues through the end of verse 43. Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this quotation from Amos as a direct quotation if possible, since God is addressing the Israelites directly in it. You may be able to indicate its beginning with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation, as ULT does.
7:42	gplm	208224	Double Negatives [26679]	You did not offer slain beasts and offerings to me	1	The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **did you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Did you offer slain beasts and offerings to me for 40 years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?”
7:42	qsp4	208225	Rhetorical Question [26724]	You did not offer slain beasts and offerings to me	1	Speaking through the prophet Amos, God used the question form to emphasize to the people of **Israel** that they did not really worship Him **in the wilderness** with their sacrifices. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You did not honor me when you offered slain beasts and sacrifices for 40 years in the wilderness, O house of Israel!”
7:42	fsy1	208226	Forms of ‘You’ — Singular [26735]	You did not offer  &  did you	1	**You** is plural in these instances, even though the addressee (**house**) is singular, because God is actually speaking to all of the Israelites. If it would not be natural in your language to use the plural in such a case, you could use singular **you** in your translation.
7:42	qb2c	208227	Merism [26705]	slain beasts and offerings	1	In a figure of speech, God is using the two main categories of sacrifices, those that involve shedding blood (**slain beasts**) and those that are bloodless (**offerings**), to mean sacrifices of all kinds. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “all kinds of sacrifices”
7:42	lisy	208228	Metaphor [26706]	O house of Israel	1	Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So the **house of Israel** means all the people descended from the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “nation of Israel” or “people of Israel”
7:43	fhpi	208229		And you took up the tabernacle of Molech	1	The quotation from the prophet Amos continues here.
7:43	ngn9	208230	Connect — Contrast Relationship [26743]	And	1	**And** at the beginning of this verse introduces God’s own answer to the question he asked in the previous verse, 7:42: “You did not offer slain beasts and offerings to me … , did you?” The answer is in contrast to what the question asks. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation, followed by a sentence break: “No!”
7:43	z6hp	208231	Irony [26702]	you took up  &  I will remove you	1	The term **took up** indicates that the Israelites carried the idols this verse describes around with them as they traveled in the wilderness. The term **remove** in this context means that God will send them into exile as a punishment, with the sense of carrying them away from their homeland. So the punishment is ironic; if possible, use similar terms in your language that will bring out this irony. Alternate translation: “you carried around … I will carry you away”
7:43	pkib	208232	Forms of ‘You’ — Singular [26735]	you took up  &  your  &  you made  &  you	1	As in 7:42, **you** is plural here, even though the addressee (“house”) is singular, since God is speaking to all of the Israelites. In this verse **your** is also plural. If it would not be natural in your language to use the plural in these cases, you could use the singular in your translation.
7:43	j5wq	208233	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the tabernacle of Molech	1	The **tabernacle of Molech** was a tent or shrine that housed an idol of the false god Molech. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly, as UST does.
7:43	mgz0	208234	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the star of your god Rephan	1	The Israelites were not carrying around an actual **star**, but an image designed to look like a star. This image was used in the worship of the false god Rephan. (This may have been the planet Saturn.) Alternate translation: “the star-shaped image of your god Rephan”
7:43	y5qo	208235	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the images that you made	1	The word **images** refers to the idol of Molech and the star-shaped image of Rephan. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “You made that idol of Molech and that star-shaped image of Rephan so that you could worship those false gods.”
7:43	yrqe	208236	Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship [26745]	and	1	Speaking through Amos, God uses the word translated **and** to introduce what he will do as a result of the Israelites’ unfaithfulness and disobedience. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “As a result”
7:43	whkt	208237	Quote Markings [26720]	I will remove you beyond Babylon	1	This is the end of the quotation from the prophet Amos that began in verse 42. See how you marked the beginning of the quotation there. It would be appropriate to mark its ending here with a closing second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a second-level quotation. If you used special formatting to set off the quotation, you could return to regular formatting after this verse.

7:44	fkx1	208239	Ellipsis [26681]	The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, just as the one speaking to Moses had commanded	1	Stephen is not saying that the **tabernacle** was **with** the Israelites just as God had commanded. He means that the tabernacle was built **according to the pattern** that Moses saw on Mount Sinai. To make this clear, it may be helpful to supply some of the words that Stephen is leaving out. It may also be helpful to introduce a sentence break. Alternate translation: “The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness. It was built just as the one speaking to Moses had commanded”
7:44	u9vu	208240	Metonymy [26707]	The tabernacle of the testimony	1	Stephen calls this tent the **tabernacle of the testimony** by association with the way it housed the ark of the covenant, which was also known as the ark of the testimony. The “testimony” of the ark, as UST indicates, was to the covenant between God and the Israelites and to his presence with them wherever they went in the wilderness. Alternate translation: “the tent that housed the ark of the covenant”
7:44	mkte	208241	Information Structure [26700]	just as the one speaking to Moses had commanded, to make it according to the pattern that he had seen	1	It may be more natural to put the information about the command to Moses before the information about how Moses fulfilled the command.

Alternate translation: “The one speaking to Moses had commanded him to make the tabernacle according to the pattern that he had seen, and he made it just that way”

Alternate translation: “Our ancestors received the tabernacle from their ancestors, and they brought it in”
7:45	ulx1	208245		having received it in turn	1	The phrase **having received … in turn** translates a Greek verb that refers to receiving something in succession, in this case from one’s ancestors. Alternate translation: “having received it from their ancestors”
7:45	xiqv	208246		brought in with Joshua	1	When Stephen says that the Israelites brought in the tabernacle **with Joshua**, he does not mean that they brought in both the tabernacle and Joshua. He means that the Israelites did the things he describes in obedience to Joshua’s directions. Alternate translation: “brought in as Joshua directed them”

7:48	jruu	208263	Synecdoche [26729]	houses} made with hands	1	Stephen is using the word **hand**, one part of a person, to mean the whole person.

Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this quotation from Isaiah as a direct quotation if possible, since God is addressing the Israelites directly in it. You may be able to indicate its beginning with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation, as ULT does.

If your readers would not understand what these figures mean, you could use equivalent metaphors from your culture, or you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way.

7:49	norf	208270	Parallelism [26713]	What kind of house will you build for me?’ says the Lord,	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. God says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize the truth of what he is saying.

Up to this point, he has been identifying with the Sanhedrin members, saying “our fathers” as he describes what earlier generations of Israelites did. Now, as he shifts to rebuking them, he addresses them with the vocative **O**. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language for this same purpose. Alternate translation: “You stiff-necked people who are uncircumcised in your heart and ears”
7:51	loar	208278	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	O stiff-necked and	1	Stephen is using the adjective **stiff-necked** as a noun, to describe a kind of person.

7:51	tsac	208279	Metaphor [26706]	O stiff-necked	1	Stephen is speaking of the Sanhedrin members as if they were horses or mules that stiffened their necks in order not to be turned in one direction or another. He means that they are being stubborn. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture, or you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “O stubborn”
7:51	rj5w	208280	Metonymy [26707]	uncircumcised in heart and ears	1	Stephen speaks of the Sanhedrin members’ **heart and ears** as **uncircumcised** by association with the way that Gentiles, who are uncircumcised because they are not part of the covenant community, do not obey or listen to God. Alternate translation: “unwilling to obey or listen to God”
7:51	t657	208281	Synecdoche [26729]	uncircumcised in heart and ears	1	Stephen is using one part of a person, the **heart**, meaning the desires and will, to represent all of a person in the act of obeying or disobeying.

7:51	j8dd	208282	Synecdoche [26729]	uncircumcised in heart and ears	1	Stephen is using one part of a person, the **ears**, to represent all of a person in the act of listening.

7:51	ib5g	208284	Forms of ‘You’ — Singular [26735]	You  &  your  &  you	1	The words **you** and **your** are plural, since Stephen is speaking to all the members of the Sanhedrin. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
7:51	br6l	208285	Ellipsis [26681]	As your fathers, also you	1	Stephen is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “As your ancestors disobeyed God and did not listen to him, so you disobey God and do not listen to him”
7:52	gfd2	208286	Rhetorical Question [26724]	Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute	1	Stephen is not asking for information. He is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Your ancestors persecuted each of the prophets!”
7:52	dzf2	208287	Hyperbole [26695]	Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute	1	Stephen’s rhetorical question has an implicit generalization for emphasis.

7:52	zpgz	208288	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	of the Righteous One	1	Stephen is using the adjective **Righteous** as a noun in order to describe a specific person. ULT adds **One** to show this.

7:53	iv4h	208291	Synecdoche [26729]	who received	1	The Sanhedrin members whom Stephen is addressing did not receive **the law** themselves. Rather, Stephen is using them to represent the entire Jewish community down through the years.

7:53	b0ku	208292	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	by directions of angels	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that he is referring to God giving the law to the Israelites at Mount Sinai. A later Jewish tradition said that angels acted as God’s intermediaries at that time. (Stephen says in 7:38 that an angel was speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “as angels delivered it on Mount Sinai”
7:54	wywd	208293	Active or Passive [26672]	hearing these things, they were cut to their hearts	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

7:54	x8tm	208294	Idiom [26697]	they were cut to their hearts	1	Here, the expression **they were cut to their hearts** is an idiom that means the Sanhedrin members became very angry.

7:55	ij2b	208296	Metaphor [26706]	full of the Holy Spirit	1	Luke is speaking of Stephen as if he were a container that the Holy Spirit could fill. Alternate translation: “inspired by the Holy Spirit”
7:55	zkt0	208297	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	looking intently into heaven, he saw	1	The implication is that only Stephen saw this vision, not anyone else who was present. Alternate translation: “staring up into heaven, he saw in a vision”
7:55	u7uh	208298	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the glory of God	1	The implication is that Stephen saw a bright light that expressed the magnificent presence of God.

7:55	xueb	208299	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	Jesus standing at the right of God	1	Luke is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate the right side.

7:55	ehfq	208300	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	Jesus standing at the right of God	1	In this culture, the place at the right side of a ruler was a position of honor.

7:55	u5do	208301	Symbolic Action [26816]	Jesus standing at the right of God	1	Elsewhere in the New Testament, Jesus is described as “sitting” **at the right of God**. Many interpreters believe that Jesus stood on this occasion to honor Stephen for his courage and faithful testimony. If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “Jesus, in a place of honor next to God, standing to honor him”
7:56	f5ni	208302	Metaphor [26706]	Behold	1	Stephen is using the term **behold** to focus his listeners’ attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Now listen”

7:56	bof3	208304	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the Son of Man	1	The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus himself used that title to claim that role subtly and implicitly.

Alternate translation: “Jesus the Messiah”
7:56	kww4	208305	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	standing at the right of God	1	See how you translated the nominal adjective **right** in 7:55. Alternate translation: “standing at the right side of God”

7:57	dsta	208309	Idiom [26697]	shouting with a loud voice	1	This is an idiom that suggests that the Sanhedrin members had another, louder voice that they could use. It means that they raised the volume of their voices. Alternate translation: “shouting loudly”
7:57	em5q	208310		shouting with a loud voice	1	If you would like to reproduce this idiom but it would be unusual in your language to speak as if a whole group of people had one **voice**, you could make this plural. Alternate translation: “with loud voices” or “in loud voices”

7:58	evc1	208312	Metaphor [26706]	throwing him outside the city	1	Luke is likely speaking when he speaks of the Sanhedrin members **throwing** Stephen outside the city.

7:58	a7pa	208313	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the witnesses	1	These were the “false witnesses” whom the Sanhedrin brought in to accuse Stephen, as described in 6:13. According to the Law of Moses, it was their responsibility to carry out the execution of the man they had accused. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the false witnesses, who were responsible to carry out the execution,”
7:58	gtbt	208314	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	laid aside their outer garments at the feet of a young man named Saul	1	The implications are that the witnesses took off their long robes so that they could throw stones at Stephen more easily and that they left them with Saul for safekeeping.

7:60	uara	208322	Double Negatives [26679]	do not hold this sin against them	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **hold … against**. Alternate translation: “forgive them for this sin”
7:60	bx35	208323	Euphemism [26682]	he fell asleep	1	Luke is describing the death of Stephen when he says **he fell asleep**. This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant.

8:1	ha3r	208324	Background Information [26829]	And Saul was agreeing with his execution	1	Luke is providing this background information to help readers understand why Saul was persecuting the church, as he relates in 8:3 and in Chapter 9.

8:1	ckvf	208326	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	on that day	1	Here, **day** is not a figurative word for “time.” Luke is referring to a specific day, the day on which Stephen was killed.

8:1	px9i	208327	Active or Passive [26672]	they all were scattered	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they all fled”

8:4	rof2	208334	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	the ones having been scattered	1	Luke is using the participle **having been scattered**, which functions as an adjective, as a noun.

Alternate translation: “the believers who had been scattered”
8:4	r4tx	208335	Active or Passive [26672]	the ones having been scattered	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could state this in active form. See how you translated it in 8:1. Alternate translation: “the believers who had fled from the persecution”

Alternate translation: “telling the good news about Jesus”
8:5	d24l	208337	Idiom [26697]	going down	1	Luke speaks of Philip **going down** from Jerusalem because that was the customary way of speaking about traveling from Jerusalem, since that city is up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “traveling”
8:5	c7nm	208338	Idiom [26697]	the city of Samaria	1	This is an idiom that means the principal city in the region of Samaria, probably the one known at that time as Sebaste, although some interpreters believe that Luke may have had the city of Sychar in mind instead.

This may be because the unclean spirits controlled people to such an extent that the spirits seemed to be the people themselves. It may be helpful to your readers to put the information about the spirits before the information about the people who had them.

8:7	c32o	208350	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	many  &  paralyzed	1	Luke is using the participle **paralyzed** as an adjective. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “many who had been paralyzed”

He claimed to be “the power … that is called Great,” but now he recognizes that **works** of power that are truly **great** are done in the name of Jesus. If your language has a word for works that demonstrate power that has the same root as its word for power, it would be appropriate to use it here.
8:13	n8zx	208375	Doublet [26680]	And  &  signs and works	1	The terms **signs** and **works** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation, as in UST: “miracles”

Alternate translation: “Please allow me to be baptized.” (2) a genuine request for information, since Philip seems to answer this question in 8:37 by identifying something that could keep the official from being baptized. Alternate translation: “Is there a condition I must meet in order to be baptized?”
8:36	wyr9	208461	Active or Passive [26672]	my being baptized	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you from baptizing me”

ULT and UST indicate this by putting the verse in brackets. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider including this verse if that translation does. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you indicate in some way that this verse may not be original, such as by putting it in brackets or in a footnote.
8:37	a0if	208463	Metaphor [26706]	If you believe from your whole heart	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and intentions. Alternate translation: “If you genuinely believe in Jesus and want to be his disciple”

Rather, the word **for** seems simply to introduce a continuation of the narrative. Alternate translation: “but” or “nevertheless”
8:40	fe5j	208469	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	Philip was found at Azotus	1	The implication is that there was no indication of Philip traveling between where he baptized the Ethiopian and Azotus.

Alternate translation: “making murderous threats against”

9:3	hexx	208486		a light from heaven surrounded him	1	Alternate translation: “a light from heaven shone all around him”
9:3	bhy2	208487		from heaven	1	This could mean: (1) heaven, where God lives or (2) the sky. The first meaning is preferable. Use that meaning if your language has a separate word for it.

9:10	zbzn	208499	How to Translate Names [26805]	Ananias	1	**Ananias** is the name of a man. This is not the same Ananias whom Luke described in 5:1 (that man died), but you may translate the name here the same way you did there.

9:11	xh69	208504	Active or Passive [26672]	the street called Straight	1	If your language does not use the passive form **called**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation, as in UST: “the street that people call Straight”

9:11	h0ok	208506	How to Translate Names [26805]	of Judas	1	**Judas** it the name of a man. This is not the disciple who betrayed Jesus (that man died); this Judas was the owner of a house in Damascus where Saul was staying. But you may translate the name here the same way you did in 1:13, 1:16, and 5:37 for the disciple and two other men with the same name.

Alternate translation: “those who heard … the man who destroyed … those who call”
9:21	h76w	208541	Rhetorical Question [26724]	Is not this the one having destroyed in Jerusalem the ones calling on this name? And he had come here for this, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests	1	The people in Damascus are using the question form to emphasize that Saul was indeed the man who had persecuted the believers in Jerusalem and had come to Damascus to arrest the believers there. If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “This is the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who call on this name! And he come here for this, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests!”
9:21	yilj	208542	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the ones calling on this name	1	By **this name** the speakers implicitly mean the name of Jesus. Alternate translation: “the ones calling on the name of Jesus”

9:23	gg13	208548	Idiom [26697]	when many days were filled	1	As in 2:1 and 7:23, this is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “after many days”
9:23	dwev	208549	Active or Passive [26672]	when many days were filled	1	Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” but use an active verbal form instead of the passive form here. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here.
9:23	y1i7	208550	Synecdoche [26729]	the Jews	1	Luke is using the name of a whole group, **the Jews**, to refer to one part of that group, its leaders. Alternate translation: “the leaders of the Jews”

9:24	sfjt	208552	Information Structure [26700]	But their plot became known to Saul	1	This could mean: (1) that a person realized there was a plot by recognizing that the Jewish leaders were watching the gates, and that person told Saul. In that case it may be helpful to move this information to the end of the verse, as UST does. (2) that someone told Saul about the plot, but even so, he was not able to flee for his life, because the gates were being watched.

12:23	u7sy	208936	Active or Passive [26672]	having become worm-eaten, he died	1	The word translated **worm-eaten** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be clearer for your readers if you use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. The word **worm-eaten** expresses the result of action by a different agent, so you can use an active form with that agent as the subject. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. UST models one way to do this.
12:23	m94s	208937	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	having become worm-eaten, he died	1	It is not clear exactly what this means, and you might choose to say nothing further in your translation. However, this could mean: (1) that when the angel **struck** Herod, this caused a deep wound, and by the time Herod died of this wound, it was already infested with maggots. Alternate translation: “he died after his wound became so infected that it was infested with maggots” (2) that the word **struck** is figurative and it refers to an illness, a severe case of intestinal worms. Alternate translation: “he got such a severe case of intestinal worms that he died”
12:24	i8qb	208938	Hendiadys [26694]	the word of God was increasing and was being multiplied	1	Luke is expressing a single idea by using two verbs connected with **and.** The verb **being multiplied** tells in what way the word of God was **increasing**, that is, very rapidly. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this same idea with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the word of God was increasing very rapidly”
12:24	q2c9	208939	Personification [26716]	the word of God was increasing and was being multiplied	1	Luke is speaking of the way the message about Jesus was becoming more widespread as if the word of God itself were **increasing** and **being multiplied**. Alternate translation: “more and more people were hearing and believing the word of God”
12:24	k53g	208940	Metonymy [26707]	the word of God	1	Luke is using the term **word** to mean the message about Jesus that God told the believers to spread by using words. Alternate translation: “the message about Jesus”
12:24	md7u	208941	Active or Passive [26672]	was being multiplied	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God was multiplying it”
12:25	e87c	208942	End of Story [26831]	Then	1	Luke uses the word translated **Then** to introduce information about what happened after Herod died. This is the end of the part of the story about him. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a significant part of a larger story.
12:25	vk0l	208943	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	Then Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem,having completed their service	1	This can also be translated, “Then Barnabas and Saul returned, having completed their service in Jerusalem.” If that is the correct translation, then Luke is saying implicitly that they **returned** to Antioch. Alternate translation: “Then Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch, having completed their service in Jerusalem”
12:25	ddg0	208944	Textual Variants [26819]	Then Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem	1	Some ancient copies say that Barnabas and Saul returned “from” Jerusalem, which makes sense, since in the next verse, Barnabas and Saul are back in Antioch. If the reading **to** is correct, this verse may be indicating that they went somewhere else in Judea and then returned to Jerusalem before going back to Antioch. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, you may wish to follow the readings of ULT and UST.
12:25	uqp5	208945	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	having completed their service	1	This refers implicitly to the trip that Barnabas and Saul made to Jerusalem to deliver money from the believers in Antioch, which Luke describes in 11:29–30. Alternate translation: “having delivered to the church leaders in Jerusalem the money that the believers in Antioch had collected”
12:25	r08j	208946	Active or Passive [26672]	John, called Mark	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. See how you translated it in 12:12. Alternate translation: “John, whom people called Mark”
13:1	o5y0	208947	Introduction of a New Event [26833]	Now	1	Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
13:1	sqty	208948	How to Translate Names [26805]	Simeon called Niger	1	The word **Simeon** is the name of a man. The word **Niger** is another name by which he was known. This is not a racial epithet; it is the Latin word for “black,” and it probably indicates that he was African. Alternate translation: “Simeon the African”
13:1	zk0b	208949	Active or Passive [26672]	Simeon called Niger	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Simeon, whom people called Niger”
13:1	a1m7	208950	How to Translate Names [26805]	Manaen	1	The word **Manaen** is the name of a man.
13:1	x3tv	208951	How to Translate Names [26805]	Lucius the Cyrenian	1	The word **Lucius** is the name of a man. The word **Cyrenian** is the name for someone who comes from the city of Cyrene. See how you translated it in 11:20.
13:1	ag68	208952	Translate Unknowns [26822]	the foster brother	1	In this culture, rulers would sometimes bring the children of other parents into their homes to be raised and educated with their own children. This gave their children playmates and friends, and it was also a way of honoring or thanking the parents of the other children. A boy who was raised with the son of a ruler would be considered the **foster brother** of that son. There may be a similar role in your culture, and your language may have a term for it that you can use in your translation. You could also explain the meaning of the term “foster brother,” as UST does. Alternate translation: “the childhood playmate” or “the boyhood friend”
13:1	z08f	208953	Translate Unknowns [26822]	of Herod the tetrarch	1	In the Roman Empire, a **tetrarch** was the governor of one of four divisions of a country or province. **Herod the tetrarch** ruled over Galilee, one of four areas that the kingdom of his father, Herod the Great, was divided into after his death. (The Herod described in Chapter 12 was a different man, the grandson of Herod the Great and the nephew of Herod the tetrarch.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a general term instead of “tetrarch.” Alternate translation: “the ruler Herod”
13:2	zkjv	208954	Idiom [26697]	while they were ministering to the Lord	1	The expression **ministering to** means that the believers in Antioch were worshiping God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “while they were worshiping the Lord”
13:2	xutn	208955	Politeness [26837]	to the Lord	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, Peter is referring to Jesus here by a respectful title. Use a form for addressing someone respectfully in your language. Alternate translation: “of the Lord Jesus”
13:2	jqhv	208956		Separate	1	Alternate translation: “Set apart”
13:2	j2nf	208957	When to Keep Information Implicit [26689]	for the work to which I have called them	1	The Holy Spirit is referring implicitly to the **work** of proclaiming the gospel of Jesus in new areas, Cyprus and Asia Minor. Since Luke describes Barnabas and Paul doing this work in the rest of this chapter and in Chapter 14, you do not need to explain its meaning further here.
13:3	p6kk	208958	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	having fasted and prayed, and having laid {their} hands on them, they released them	1	The pronouns **their** and **they** refer to the believers in Antioch, and the pronoun **them** refers to Barnabas and Saul. The phrase **having fasted and prayed** refers to all of them. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “after they had all fasted and prayed together, the believers in Antioch laid their hands on Barnabas and Saul, and then the believers released them”
13:3	wzp0	208959	Symbolic Action [26816]	having laid {their} hands on them	1	The believers in Antioch **laid their hands** on Barnabas and Saul as a symbolic action to show that they were sending them on their mission with the blessing and support of the whole church and that they were entrusting them to God’s care.

13:3	a172	208960	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	they released them	1	While in this context the term **released** basically means “sent off,” the implication is that the believers in Antioch were freeing Barnabas and Saul of all of their responsibilities in the church so that they could go on the mission on which the Holy Spirit was sending them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they gave them the freedom to go on their new mission”
13:4	rrka	208961	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	they, having been sent out	1	The pronoun **they** refers to Barnabas and Saul. Alternate translation: “Barnabas and Saul”

13:6	zywx	208968	Idiom [26697]	they found	1	The word **found** does not mean that Barnabas, Saul, and Mark were intentionally searching for a certain man. They happened to meet him. Alternate translation: “they happened to meet”
13:6	vnls	208969	Translate Unknowns [26822]	a certain man, a magician	1	The word **magician** here does not mean someone who entertains others with tricks based on slight of hand and optical illusions.

13:6	fbok	208970	How to Translate Names [26805]	whose name {was} Bar Jesus	1	The words **Bar Jesus** are a name that means “Son of Jesus.” However, there was no relation between this man and Jesus Christ. **Jesus** was a common name at that time.

13:8	myim	208975	Active or Passive [26672]	for thus is his name translated	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “for that is how one translates his name”
13:8	at0y	208976	Metaphor [26706]	seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith	1	Here, **to turn** someone **away from** something is a metaphor for convincing someone to not do something. Alternate translation: “he attempted to persuade the governor not to believe the gospel message”
13:9	tfsr	208977	Metaphor [26706]	being filled with the Holy Spirit	1	Luke is speaking of Paul as if he were a container that the Holy Spirit **filled**. Alternate translation: “inspired by the Holy Spirit”

13:10	cwiu	208979	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	O full of all deceit and all trickery	1	Paul is using the adjective **full** as a noun to identify Elymas as a person who is full of the negative qualities he describes. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “O you who are full of all deceit and all trickery”
13:10	vqib	208980	Abstract Nouns [26671]	O full of all deceit and all trickery	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas of **deceit** and **trickery**, you could express the same idea in another way.

13:10	cv4a	208982	Doublet [26680]	of all deceit and all trickery	1	The terms **deceit** and **wickedness** mean similar things. Paul may be using the two terms together for emphasis.

13:10	dzow	208983	Hyperbole [26695]	of all deceit and all trickery	1	Paul says **all** in these two instances as a generalization for emphasis.

13:10	wro1	208984	Idiom [26697]	son of the devil	1	The expression **son of** describes a person who shares the qualities of something or someone else. Paul is saying that Elymas is acting like the devil in trying to keep Sergius Paulus from believing in Jesus. Alternate translation: “you who are acting like the devil”
13:10	raz7	208985	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	son of the devil	1	Paul is drawing an implicit contrast between Elymas’ claim to be the “son of Jesus” (Bar Jesus) and his actual character as a **son of the devil**. If you retain the “son of” idiom in your translation, you could bring out this contrast explicitly. If you do, it may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “You are not the son of Jesus—you are the son of the devil!”
13:10	kk3j	208986	Personification [26716]	enemy of all righteousness	1	Paul is speaking of **righteousness** as if it were a person who could have an **enemy**.

13:10	b85f	208988	Rhetorical Question [26724]	will you not stop turning aside the straight paths of the Lord	1	Paul is using the question form to rebuke Elymas for opposing God.

Alternate translation: “you must stop turning aside the straight paths of the Lord!”
13:10	ngba	208989	Metaphor [26706]	turning aside the straight paths of the Lord	1	Paul is speaking of Elymas as if he were physically redirecting **paths** that God wanted people to follow so that these paths no longer went **straight**.

13:11	qx0k	208990	Metaphor [26706]	behold	1	Paul is using the term **behold** to focus Elymas’ attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation.

13:11	qpe7	208992	Hendiadys [26694]	blind, not seeing the sun	1	Paul is using a word and a phrase together to express a single idea.

13:11	u05v	208993	Metaphor [26706]	a mist and darkness fell upon him	1	Paul is speaking of this **mist** and **darkness** as if they were going to **fall** on Elymas. Alternate translation: “what Elymas could see became blurry and then dark” or see the next note for another possibility.
13:11	o2rs	208994	Hendiadys [26694]	a mist and darkness fell upon him	1	Luke may be using the two words **mist** and **darkness** together to express a single idea. The word **mist** may tell what kind of **darkness** was all that Elymas could see. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “a misty darkness was all that Elymas could see”
13:12	yv6f	208995		the proconsul	1	A **proconsul** was a governor in charge of a Roman province. Alternate translation: “the governor”
13:12	n9f8	208996	Active or Passive [26672]	being astonished at the teaching of the Lord	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

13:12	ze5s	208997	Metonymy [26707]	the teaching of the Lord	1	Luke is using the word **teaching** to mean the truth and power associated with the teaching about Jesus. Alternate translation: “the truth and power that accompanied the teaching of the Lord”
13:12	njjm	208998	Possession [26717]	the teaching of the Lord	1	In this possessive form, **the Lord** is the object rather than the subject of **teaching**. That is, this does not mean “what the Lord taught,” it means “what Barnabas and Paul taught about the Lord.” you could state that as an alternate translation.
13:13	ij7c	208999	Introduction of a New Event [26833]	Now	1	Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
13:13	uu3h	209000	Background Information [26829]	the ones around Paul	1	The phrase **those around Paul** refers to Barnabas and John (who is also called John Mark). This phrase provides some background to the rest of the story by indicating that Paul had become the leader of the group. It is important to communicate this by keeping Paul’s name first when he is mentioned with others, for example, in 13:46, 13:50, etc. The order of names is important.
13:13	mkyv	209001		the ones around Paul	1	Alternate translation: “Paul and his traveling companions”
13:13	oty8	209002	How to Translate Names [26805]	Perga of Pamphylia	1	The word **Perga** is the name of a city, and the word **Pamphylia** is the name of the province in which that city was located.

13:14	v7o0	209004	Symbolic Action [26816]	they sat down	1	Paul and Barnabas may have **sat down** in the place where rabbis would sit, or in the way that rabbis would sit, as a way of asking permission to speak to the congregation. The fact that they were invited to speak (13:15) suggests that this is the case. Alternate translation: “sat down as rabbis would, to ask permission to speak to the congregation”
13:15	rl0j	209005	How to Translate Names [26805]	of the Law and the Prophets	1	The word **Law** is the name for one part of the Hebrew Scriptures, and the word **Prophets** is the name for another part of the Hebrew Scriptures. Even though these are common nouns, Luke is using them to mean specific things. Show this in your translation in the way that is natural in your language.
13:15	u3eh	209006	Idiom [26697]	Men, brothers	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “Our brothers” or “You brothers of ours”

13:16	oto8	209010	Symbolic Action [26816]	arising	1	Here the term **arising** means that Paul stood up to show that he indeed wanted to speak, as he had been invited to do. See how you translated the similar expression in 2:14. Alternate translation: “standing up to show that he wanted to speak”
13:16	tm1x	209011	Symbolic Action [26816]	motioning with {his} hand	1	This likely means that Paul waved his hand to get the attention of the audience and signal that he was about to speak. He wanted everyone in the synagogue to hear what he had to say from the very first word, so he did this to quiet them. Alternate translation: “waving his hand to signal that he was about to speak”

That is what Paul means here. See how you translated the similar expression in 10:2. Alternate translation: “you Gentiles who sincerely worship the God of Israel”
13:16	e80q	209014	Imperatives — Other Uses [26698]	listen	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a request.

13:17	c0lh	209018	Metonymy [26707]	exalted the people	1	When Paul says that God **exalted the people** of Israel when they were in Egypt, he is referring to the way God made them great in number and strength even while they were still slaves.

13:18	xoz8	209020	Textual Variants [26819]	he endured them	1	This means “he put up with their disobedience.” Some ancient copies have a different word that means “he took care of them,” which makes sense, since in this part of his speech, Paul is listing all of the good things that God did for the Israelites. Paul would be quoting Deuteronomy 1:13 from a well-known Greek translation. If the reading **put up with them** is correct, Paul may be foreshadowing the warning he gives at the end of his speech in 13:40–41. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, you may wish to follow the readings of ULT and UST. Alternate translation: “he took care of them”
13:19	pzoc	209021	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	he gave them their land for an inheritance	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God, the pronoun **them** refers to the Israelites, and the pronoun **their** refers to the seven nations that God destroyed.

15:15	qunl	209301	Active or Passive [26672]	as it is written	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “as one of the prophets wrote” or “as the prophet Amos wrote”
15:16	zmjs	209302	Quote Markings [26720]	After these things I will return	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter about whether to represent this as the beginning of a third-level quotation or a second-level quotation, or whether to use some other punctuation or convention that is available in your language to indicate who the various speakers are in verses 16–18.
15:16	e86i	209303	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	I will return,	1	The pronoun **I** refers to God, who is speaking through the prophet Amos. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “I, God, will return”
15:16	j9n4	209304	Metaphor [26706]	I will return	1	God is speaking of showing favor to the Israelites once again as if he had gone somewhere else but will now **return**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will show favor to the Israelites once again”
15:16	pn2f	209305	Parallelism [26713]	I will rebuild the fallen tent of David,	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “I will rebuild the fallen tent of David, yes, I will rebuild its ruins and restore it”
15:16	nddb	209306	Metaphor [26706]	I will rebuild the fallen tent of David,	1	God is speaking of the royal dynasty of David as if it were a **tent** that had **fallen** down. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

15:16	u5np	209307	Active or Passive [26672]	the fallen tent of David	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the tent of David that has fallen”
15:17	g1ak	209308	When Masculine Words Include Women [26690]	remnant of men	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, God is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. You may wish to indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “the remnant of humanity”
15:17	j8ww	209309	First, Second or Third Person [26670]	may seek the Lord	1	God is speaking about himself in the third person. Alternate translation: “may seek me, the Lord”
15:17	s678	209310	Metaphor [26706]	may seek the Lord	1	God is speaking as if the Gentiles would literally **seek** or look for him. The expression means that the Gentiles will begin to worship God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “may begin to worship the Lord”
15:17	ei7d	209311	Making Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information Explicit [26688]	upon whom my name has been called upon them	1	It might seem that this phrase contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you could shorten it. Alternate translation: “upon whom my name has been called”
15:17	x96u	209312	Active or Passive [26672]	upon whom my name has been called upon them	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whom I have called by my name”
15:17	tpl1	209313	Metonymy [26707]	upon whom my name has been called upon them	1	See how you translated the similar expression in 15:14. (1) Alternate translation: “who will belong to me” (2) Alternate translation: “who will worship me”
15:18	tohx	209314	Active or Passive [26672]	known	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that people have known”
15:19	bwvu	209315	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	not to trouble the ones from the Gentiles turning to God	1	In your translation, you could make explicit in what way James does not want to **trouble** these **Gentiles**. Alternate translation: “that we should not require the Gentiles who are believing in God to be circumcised and obey the laws of Moses”
15:19	lutp	209316	Metaphor [26706]	turning to God	1	James is speaking of these Gentiles as if they are physically **turning** to God. He means that they are believing in the true God and starting to live in a way that pleases him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning of this expression plainly. Alternate translation: “believing in God and obeying him”
15:20	zzqj	209317	Verse Bridges [26824]		1	James lists four regulations in this verse and he gives the reason for them in the next verse. To put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge for verses 19–21. It might say something like this: “Therefore, I judge that we should not trouble the Gentiles who are turning to God. However, since Moses has had those proclaiming him in every city from ancient generations—he is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath—we should write to the Gentiles to abstain from the pollution of idols and sexual immorality and strangled things and blood.”
15:20	qhwq	209318	Abstract Nouns [26671]	from the pollution of idols	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **pollution**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “from things that idols have polluted”
15:20	yynq	209319	Possession [26717]	from the pollution of idols	1	If your language would not use a possessive form here, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “from things that idols have polluted”
15:20	d7g7	209320	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	from the pollution of idols	1	James is likely talking about food that has been offered to **idols**, and he is speaking as if being offered to idols has polluted this food. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from eating food that has been offered to idols”
15:20	bxjz	209321	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the strangled and blood	1	God did not allow the Jews to consume blood in any form. Therefore, for one thing, they could not eat the meat from an animal that had been **strangled**, because the blood would not have been properly drained from the body of the animal. For another thing, while James is not saying that the Gentiles should have no contact at all with blood, he is saying implicitly that they should not consume blood. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand the sentence. Alternate translation: “from eating the meat of animals that have been killed by strangulation, because this meat still contains blood, and from consuming blood”
15:20	yiby	209322	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	and the strangled	1	James is using the adjective **strangled** as a noun to mean animals that have been killed by strangulation. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “animals that have been killed by strangulation”
15:20	ucm0	209323	Metonymy [26707]	the strangled	1	James is referring by association to meat from animals that have been killed by strangulation.

15:21	eubk	209324	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	For Moses has by city, from ancient generations, ones proclaiming him, being read in the synagogues on every Sabbath	1	James is saying implicitly that Gentile believers should observe at least the four regulations he has listed because they embody essential aspects of the law of Moses (not worshiping idols, not practicing sexual immorality, and respecting the blood of sacrifices), and the law of Moses is well known because it is read aloud regularly in the Jewish synagogues. If the Gentiles did not observe even these regulations, that would upset Jewish believers and make Jews who were not yet believers more hostile to Christianity. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand what James is saying. UST models one way to do this.
15:21	k4gg	209325	Metonymy [26707]	Moses has by city, from ancient generations, ones proclaiming him, being read	1	James is using the name **Moses** to mean the law associated with Moses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “people have been proclaiming the law of Moses by city from ancient generations; it is read”
15:21	g3jh	209326	Active or Passive [26672]	being read	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “People read him” or “People read from the law of Moses”
15:21	zr4r	209327	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	by city	1	The expression **by city** means “in every city,” and James implicitly means every city in which there are Jews.

15:22	x90v	209329	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	the whole church	1	Luke assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to the **church** in Jerusalem. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand this sentence. Alternate translation: “the church in Jerusalem” or “all the people of the church in Jerusalem”
15:22	prw9	209330	How to Translate Names [26805]	Judas called Barsabbas	1	The words **Judas** and **Barsabbas** are the names of men. **Barsabbas** was another name by which **Judas** was known. **Barsabbas** is probably a patronymic, that is, an indication of who his father was. If your language and culture identify people by patronymics, it may be helpful to translate this name as “the son of Sabbas,” as UST does. See how you translated this same name for another man in 1:23.
15:22	d7lr	209331	Active or Passive [26672]	Judas called Barsabbas	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Judas, whom people called Barsabbas”

15:23	xfy0	209333	Metonymy [26707]	writing by their hand	1	Luke does not mean that the apostles and elders ask Judas and Silas to write out this letter for them. Rather, Luke is using the word **hand** to mean that Judas and Silas carried the letter and delivered it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “sending the following letter with them”
15:23	lab0	209334	Forms of ‘You’ — Dual/Plural [26733]	their hand	1	Since Luke is referring to two people, it might be more natural in your language to use the dual or plural form here, as your language may require. Alternate translation: “their hands”
15:23	ic14	209335		The apostles and the elders, brothers, to the brothers among the Gentiles throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: Greetings	1	This is the introduction of the letter. In the culture of this time, letter writers would give their own names first. Your language and culture may have its own way of introducing the author of a letter and saying to whom it is written. Alternate translation: “This letter is from your brothers, the apostles and elders. We are writing to you Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. Greetings to you” or “To our Gentile brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. Greetings from the apostles and elders, your brothers”
15:23	qr5q	209336	Metaphor [26706]	brothers, to the brothers	1	The apostles and elders are using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith.

15:24	p7w1	209338	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	from us	1	The apostles and elders seem to mean implicitly that these people have gone out from their community, but not from among themselves. That is, the word **some** refers to people who were part of the church in Jerusalem, but who were not apostles or elders. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand the sentence. Alternate translation: “from our community” or “from here in Judea”
15:24	cduu	209339	Metonymy [26707]	with words	1	The apostles and elders are using the term **words** to mean what the people who have gone out from them have been teaching by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by what they have been teaching”
15:24	i7ay	209340	Synecdoche [26729]	upsetting your souls	1	The apostles and elders are using one part of the people to whom they are writing, their **souls**, to mean the people themselves. Alternate translation: “upsetting you”

15:26	ch64	209343	Metaphor [26706]	having handed over their souls	1	The letter is speaking as if Paul and Barnabas have literally **handed over** their lives. This means that they have been willing to risk their lives. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having put their lives at risk”
15:26	r99d	209344	Metonymy [26707]	for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ	1	This is a figurative expression. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. This could mean: (1) that the **name** of Jesus represents his person. Alternate translation: “out of loyalty to our Lord Jesus Christ” (2) that the **name** of Jesus represents his cause in the world. Alternate translation: “for the cause of our Lord Jesus Christ”
15:27	dhv6	209345	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	reporting the same thing	1	The letter is using the adjective **same** as a noun to mean the details of the decision that the apostles and elders have reached.

15:28	htt9	209348	Active or Passive [26672]	for no greater burden to be laid upon you	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “to lay no greater burden upon you”
15:29	v43m	209349	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	from things sacrificed to idols	1	The letter is using the adjective **sacrificed**, with the qualifier **to idols**, as a noun to mean the meat of animals that have been sacrificed to idols. (ULT adds **things** to show this.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the meat of animals that have been sacrificed to idols”
15:29	jkap	209350	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	blood	1	See how you translated **blood** in 15:20. Alternate translation: “consuming blood”
15:29	acgk	209351	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	the strangled	1	See how you translated **the strangled** in 15:20. Alternate translation: “the meat of animals that have been killed by strangulation”
15:29	fude	209352	Imperatives — Other Uses [26698]	Farewell	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a friendly wish rather than a command. This was the customary way of ending a letter in this culture. Your language may have its own way of ending a letter that you can use in your translation.

15:30	fz2h	209356	Go and Come [26692]	came down	1	You may wish to retain the idiom for travel to a lower elevation, and if so, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: “went down”

If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you indicate in some way that this verse may not be original, such as by putting it in brackets or in a footnote.

16:33	b6k3	209482	Active or Passive [26672]	he was baptized	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, the context suggests that it was Paul and Silas who baptized the jailer and his family. Alternate translation: “Paul and Silas baptized him”
16:34	s6hb	209483	Metonymy [26707]	he set a table before them	1	Luke is referring to a meal by association with the way, in this culture, a meal was served at a **table**.

16:36	tr3v	209486	Imperatives — Other Uses [26698]	coming out, go in peace	1	The word **go** is an imperative, but it communicates permission rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates permission. Alternate translation: “you may come out of the jail and go in peace”
16:36	lgnx	209487	Abstract Nouns [26671]	go in peace	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “go peacefully” or “go without being concerned that the authorities will trouble you any further”
16:37	c29j	209488	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	to them	1	The implication is that the officers whom the magistrates sent had come into the prison with the jailer. That is why Luke says **them** and not just **him**, meaning the jailer. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to the officers”
16:37	zbht	209489	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	them, “  &  they threw us  &  they cast us out  &  let them lead us out	1	The first instance of the pronoun **them** refers to the officers whom the magistrates sent to the prison, and the pronoun **they** and the second instance of the pronoun **them** refer to the magistrates.

16:37	xvtb	209490	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	us  &  they threw us  &  us  &  us	1	By **us**, Paul means himself and Silas but not the officers to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:37	ipfo	209491	Rhetorical Question [26724]	Having beaten us in public without trial, men being Romans, they threw us into prison, and now they cast us out secretly	1	Paul is using the question form to protest that what the magistrates want to do is not just or fair. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “The magistrates beat us in public without trial, men being Romans, and then they threw us into prison; I will not allow them, after doing that, to cast us out secretly!”
16:37	noqf	209492	Metonymy [26707]	Having beaten us in public	1	The magistrates did not do this themselves. They ordered soldiers to do it. Paul is speaking of the magistrates, some of the people who were involved in this action, to mean everyone who was involved. Alternate translation: “having ordered their soldiers to beat us in public”
16:37	tmxl	209493	Ellipsis [26681]	For not	1	Paul is using an expression that leaves out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “No, for they will not do that”
16:37	k1jv	209494	Reflexive Pronouns [26723]	coming themselves, let them lead us out	1	Paul is using the reflexive pronoun **themselves** for emphasis. It may be more natural in your language to express this emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “let them come in person and lead us out”

16:37	phsz	209496	When to Keep Information Implicit [26689]	let them lead us out	1	It is likely that Paul wanted the magistrates to bring him and Silas out of prison, which would effectively be an apology for mistreatment, so that the believers in Philippi would have the protection of the law even after Paul and his companions left the city. However, this is more a matter of interpretation than of implied information, so it would probably be best not to put an explanation of it in your translation. You can leave it to teachers and preachers of the Bible to explain.
16:38	l3dr	209497	Metonymy [26707]	these words	1	Luke is using the term **words** to mean what Paul said to the officers by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what Paul had said”

You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers.

In effect, they apologized to them and asked them to overlook the offense. Alternate translation: “they apologized to them”
16:40	ewwd	209502	End of Story [26831]	So	1	Luke uses the word **So** to introduce information about what happened at the end of the story of the imprisonment of Paul and Silas. Your language may have its own way of presenting such information.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and then Paul and Silas and Timothy left Philippi”
16:40	mg66	209507	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	and went out	1	Since Luke says **they … went out**, not “we went out,” the implication is that Luke remained in Philippi for a time, likely to strengthen and encourage the new believers there.

17:1	o8nc	209508	Introduction of a New Event [26833]	Now	1	Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.

17:2	evrf	209511	Pronouns — When to Use Them [26838]	them,  &  with them	1	The pronoun **them** refers the Jews who attended the synagogue in Thessalonica. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the Jews in the synagogue”
17:3	f7pq	209512	Hendiadys [26694]	fully opening them and demonstrating	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two expressions connected with **and**. The phrase **fully opening them** tells how Paul was **demonstrating** from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “by opening the Scriptures fully, demonstrating”
17:3	p2v9	209513	Metaphor [26706]	fully opening them	1	Luke is speaking as if Paul had been literally **opening** the Scriptures **fully**, as by unrolling a scroll, so that the Jews in the synagogue could understand them.

17:4	jgr7	209518	Litotes [26704]	not a few	1	Luke is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “many”

17:19	kro5	209559	Metonymy [26707]	to the Areopagus	1	Luke most likely means that the philosophers from the marketplace brought Paul to meet the main group of philosophers on the Areopagus, not that they just brought Paul to the hill itself.

17:19	nk7e	209560	Rhetorical Question [26724]	Are we able to know what this new teaching {is} that is being spoken by you	1	This is not actually a rhetorical question, since the philosophers really do want to know whether Paul is willing to explain himself more fully to the group at the Areopagus. However, if in your language it might seem to be a rhetorical question, you could translate it as a statement instead.

(It is clear that women as well as men are **present**, since Luke notes in verse 23 that Bernice entered with Agrippa.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “all of you”
25:24	ihvx	210373	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	with us	1	By **us**, Festus means himself and King Agrippa but not the rest of the crowd to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

26:8	r0rx	210402	Rhetorical Question [26724]	Why is it judged unbelievable among you if God raises the dead	1	Paul is using the question form to challenge the Jewish leaders who are accusing him. Many of them are Pharisees who believe that God does raise the dead, and yet they do not believe that God raised Jesus from the dead.

Alternate translation: “By accusing me, you are acting as if you do not believe that God raises the dead!”
26:8	ruq4	210403	Forms of ‘You’ — Singular [26735]	among you	1	While to this point Paul has used the word **you** in the singular to refer to Agrippa, here he uses it in the plural to refer to the Jewish leaders who are present.

Alternate translation: “that God raises the dead”
26:8	o5jm	210405	Idiom [26697]	raises the dead	1	Here, **raises the dead** is an idiom that refers to making someone who has died alive again. Alternate translation: “God makes the dead alive again”
26:8	z506	210406	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	the dead	1	Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun to mean people who have died. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who have died”
26:9	tan6	210407	Metonymy [26707]	the name of Jesus	1	While in such contexts the word **name** often represents the person who has that name, Paul is describing a time when he did not believe that Jesus was still alive.

Alternate translation: “when they were being put on trial for crimes with a penalty of death”
26:10	e1o3	210410	Active or Passive [26672]	when they were being executed	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

You can provide this information in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “as a member of the Sanhedrin, I cast my vote against them”
26:11	mkxp	210412	Hyperbole [26695]	punishing them in all the synagogues	1	Paul says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis.

26:12	nae3	210413	Hendiadys [26694]	with authority and a commission	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **authority** tells what kind of **commission** the **chief priests** gave Paul. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “with an authoritative commission”
26:14	nn3z	210414	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?

Alternate translation: “you should not be persecuting me!”
26:14	biri	210417	Metaphor [26706]	It is hard for you to kick against a goad	1	The voice is speaking as if Paul were literally kicking against a **goad**, that is, a sharp object that people use to prod an animal. The voice means that by opposing Jesus and persecuting believers, Paul is hurting himself. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You are hurting yourself by what you are doing”
26:15	vmcc	210418	Quotes within Quotes [26721]	And I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

26:15	cq4o	210419	Politeness [26837]	Who are you, Lord	1	When Paul replied to the voice, he was not yet acknowledging that Jesus was **Lord**. He used that respectful title because he recognized that he was speaking to someone of divine power. If this might be confusing for your readers, in your translation you could use a similar term of respect. Alternate translation: “Who are you, Sir”
26:15	tk90	210420	Politeness [26837]	the Lord said	1	In this case Paul is referring to Jesus by a respectful title. Use a form for addressing someone respectfully in your language. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus said”

Alternate translation: “He told me to get up and stand on my feet, because for this he had appeared to me, to appoint me a servant and a witness both of the things in which I had seen him and of the things in which he would be shown to me”
26:16	uweo	210422	Making Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information Explicit [26688]	get up and stand on your feet	1	It might seem that the expression **get up and stand on your feet** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language.

26:23	gf2l	210441	Connect — Factual Conditions [26740]	if the Christ would be a sufferer, if he, the first from the resurrection of the dead, was going to proclaim light	1	Paul could be speaking as if what he is saying is a hypothetical possibility even though he believes that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if the speaker believes that it is true, then you can translate these words as an affirmative statement. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Now since the Christ was a sufferer, since he was the first from the resurrection of the dead, then he was going to proclaim light”
26:23	ii6t	210442	Abstract Nouns [26671]	the first from the resurrection of the dead	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **resurrection**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the first person whom God made alive again after he died”
26:23	d32w	210443	Nominal Adjectives [26708]	of the dead	1	Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun to mean people who have died. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “of people who have died”
26:23	so2o	210444	Metaphor [26706]	he,  &  was going to proclaim light	1	Paul is saying that the truth that Jesus proclaimed about God was like a **light** that allowed people to see.

26:23	ubvo	210445	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	to the people	1	By **the people**, Paul means specifically the Jewish people. Alternate translation: “to the Jewish people”
26:24	qegj	210446	Irregular Use of Tenses [26817]	Festus says	1	To call attention to a development in the story, here Luke uses the present tense in past narration.

Alternate translation: “I am completely sane”
26:25	udbp	210449	Politeness [26837]	most excellent Festus	1	The expression **most excellent** was a formal title by which people addressed Roman officials.

In your translation, you could use a comparable expression from your language and culture. Alternate translation: “and I hope that he will pardon me for speaking so boldly as I talk to him”
26:26	cou3	210452	Double Negatives [26679]	I am not persuaded at all that any of these things eludes him	1	In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “I am not persuaded that not any of these things eludes him.” In Greek, the second negative creates a positive meaning by canceling the first negative. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You could also state the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “I am persuaded that not one of these things at all eludes him”
26:26	dc71	210453	Active or Passive [26672]	not  &  this has  &  been done in a corner	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “this did not happen in a corner”

26:27	p2ts	210456	Rhetorical Question [26724]	Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa	1	Paul asks this question to challenge **King Agrippa** to recognize that if he believes what the prophets wrote, then he should believe that Jesus rose from the dead. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this question as a statement. Alternate translation: “You should believe what I am saying about Jesus since you believe the prophets, King Agrippa.”
26:28	wzox	210457	Rhetorical Question [26724]	In little are you persuading me to make me a Christian	1	Agrippa is using the question form to challenge Paul. He is asserting that what Paul has said so far is not sufficiently persuasive. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. The term **little** could mean: (1) little proof. Alternate translation: “You cannot persuade me to become a Christian with so little proof.” (2) little time. Alternate translation: “You cannot persuade me to become a Christian in such a short time.”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “without being imprisoned”
26:31	cf6e	210460	Metonymy [26707]	This man is not doing anything worthy of death or of chains	1	The king and governor are referring to a penalty of death by association with **death** itself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “This man does not deserve to receive the death penalty or to be kept in chains”
26:31	f0ob	210461	Synecdoche [26729]	of chains	1	These people who heard Paul speak are using one aspect of imprisonment, the **chains** that bound prisoners at this time, to mean the entire state of being imprisoned.

27:1	w4d1	210464	Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information [26687]	it was decided for us to sail	1	Luke assumes that his readers will understand that he says **us** because he joined Paul at this point in the story. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand what is happening. UST models a way to do this.
27:1	nm0p	210465	Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ [26685]	for us	1	As the General Notes to this chapter explain, here and in several other places Luke says “we,” **us**, and “our” to mean himself and others who were traveling with him, but not his readers. So use the exclusive form of those words if your language marks that distinction.
27:1	knnz	210466	Introduction of New and Old Participants [26835]	to a centurion, Julius by name	1	Luke is using the phrase **a centurion** to introduce **Julius** as a new participant in the story.

Your language may have its own way of describing that. Alternate translation: “we landed at Sidon”
27:3	pz2m	210473	Abstract Nouns [26671]	to receive {their} care	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **care**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “so that they could care for him”
27:4	op9z	210474	Idiom [26697]	we sailed under Cyprus	1	The expression **sailed under** does not mean that the travelers sailed south of the island of Cyprus, such as Luke describes in 21:3, even though that would have been the shortest route. Rather, **sailed under** means that the ship kept close to the northern shore of the island, which loomed above the ship and blocked the wind. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that meaning plainly. However, if the people of your culture are familiar with sea travel, you could use the corresponding expression that is most natural in your language.

That is, ships would sail out to the northeast and southeast from the harbor, and they would enter the harbor from the northeast or southeast. Your language and culture may have a comparable expression of its own that you can use in your translation. Otherwise, you could describe this in general terms.

27:12	d0tp	210497	Metaphor [26706]	looking according to the southwest wind and according to the northwest wind	1	Luke is speaking as if the harbor of Phoenix was literally **looking** in these directions.

It does not support the weight of a person, so sailors cannot get out of a ship to free it if the ship gets stuck in quicksand. If your readers would not be familiar with quicksand, you could describe it generally in your translation. Alternate translation: “the large mass of waterlogged sand off the north coast of Africa”
